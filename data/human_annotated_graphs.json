        "document": "Prime Minister Tony Blair announced Tuesday that he had set up an inquiry into Britain's prewar intelligence on Iraq's illicit weapons, but he added that the committee would not have a mandate to examine the political decisions to go to war.\n\nThe inquiry will work largely behind closed doors and report its findings to Mr. Blair before Parliament adjourns this summer. As such, it will be much shorter than the inquiry President Bush said Monday that he would establish to examine intelligence on Iraq and report in 2005.\n\n''I think it is right,'' Mr. Blair said in a morning meeting with a parliamentary committee, ''that we have a look at the intelligence that we received and whether it is accurate or not.'' But the prime minister said he was opposed to any inquiry that reviewed the political judgments to go to war and how intelligence findings were used in support of those judgments.\n\nThe inquiry will be headed by Lord Butler, who served as private secretary to Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher, Harold Wilson and Edward Heath.\n\nMr. Blair said an inquiry had become necessary after the chief United States weapons inspector, David A. Kay, said in Washington that stocks of Iraqi chemical and biological weapons might not have existed and that intelligence assumptions about the immediate threat from Saddam Hussein might have been broadly wrong.\n\nMr. Blair made the announcement at a question and answer session with parliamentary committee chairmen. In shirt sleeves, the prime minister was affable and in good humor, admitting recent mistakes in how he had handled major legislation and asserting that the period for questioning his integrity over the preparations for war had come to an end with Lord Hutton's verdict last week. Lord Hutton found that the government had not exaggerated or deliberately distorted the intelligence on Iraq to persuade a reluctant public to go to war.\n\nMr. Blair said that Lord Hutton's was the third full inquiry into circumstances related to the war and that the only thing left to examine was the intelligence process itself.\n\n''I honestly think that the political judgment has got to be in the end the government and Parliament, and you can't subcontract that to a committee, and I don't believe frankly that the committee would want to look into that,'' Mr. Blair said.\n\nThe announcement touched off a lengthy debate in Parliament over whether the inquiry would settle the most contentious questions of how political leaders used intelligence findings to support the assertion that Saddam Hussein was an imminent threat to the region and to ''the stability of the world,'' as Mr. Blair warned in September 2002.\n\nRobin Cook, a former foreign secretary under Mr. Blair, asked from the floor of the House of Commons, ''Does he really believe he can separate the intelligence judgment on the threat from the political judgment to go to war?''\n\nBut other members like Ann Clwyd pointed out that even Kurdish leaders in Iraq believed that Mr. Hussein had chemical and biological weapons that he was ready to use on them in March. She called it a ''disgrace'' that the international community had not acted sooner to end the ''genocide'' that she said Mr. Hussein was practicing.\n\nMichael Howard, the Tory opposition leader, said his party supported the inquiry because Mr. Blair had promised that all questions on how intelligence was used in the political decision making ''came fairly and squarely within the remit of this inquiry.''\n\nThe Liberal Democratic Party refused to endorse the inquiry after lengthy negotiations with Mr. Blair and his aides on Monday night. Menzies Campbell, speaking for the Liberal Democrats during the debate, said the party had withdrawn because ''any inquiry'' that failed to address the foundation of Mr. Blair's judgments over going to war ''would be unlikely to command public confidence.''"

        "document": "Modesty has never been this city's strong suit.\n\nIn the view of chauvinistic San Franciscans -- the recent World Series aside -- there is little that's not perfect here. The scenery is perfect. The weather is perfect. The food and wine, of course, perfect.\n\nSo it stands to reason that on Saturday, when the gold medalists Marion Jones and Michael Johnson and other Left Coast Olympians pitch the Bay Area to the United States Olympic Committee as the logical American candidate for the 2012 Summer Games rather than rival New York, placid postcard imagery of picture-perfect America will prevail.\n\n''San Francisco is one of the world's favorite American brands,'' said Tony Winnicker, a spokesman for the Bay Area Sports Organizing Committee. ''The Golden Gate Bridge, the cable cars. These are not threatening icons. They are icons of romance and beauty and inspiration.''\n\nThe 4,000-page plan envisions the Greater Bay Area -- a fragmented nine-county region of 101 cities sprawling over 7,000 square miles -- as a safe, fiscally conservative, athlete-centered utopia, one where sweat will not be a problem, given bone-chilling summer fog.\n\nThe Bay Area is home to about 400 former Olympians, who flock to this ''natural amphitheater,'' in the words of the marketing material, because of the large number of sports facilities, professional coaches and cool, dry marathon-perfect weather.\n\nThe plan, whose cost is estimated at $2.4 billion, projects a budget surplus of roughly $400 million, including $170 million for athlete training endowments. It is grand in scope, foreseeing an elliptical Ring of Gold encompassing a wide area from the Monterey Peninsula, where equestrian events would be held, to a mountain biking course at the Domaine Chandon winery in the Napa Valley, and canoeing and rowing outside Sacramento.\n\nIt would include professional sports arenas like Pac Bell Park and the Oakland Coliseum. Then there are the swimming pools, tracks and other facilities at Stanford University, in Palo Alto, where the opening and closing ceremonies would take place, and at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nBesides the proximity of Vancouver, British Columbia, one of two finalists trying to land the 2010 Winter Olympics, transportation has been raised as a potential negative. The Bay Area is known for bruising traffic jams, and not for all-encompassing public transportation. In contrast to the New York proposal, which would rely on ferries and subways, planners here envision a ''cluster'' model, centered on Silicon Valley and San Francisco, that would rely largely on police-escorted shuttle buses to transport athletes to events.\n\nBut transportation improvements vital to the Olympics are under way, including a seismically sound replacement span for part of the Bay Bridge and a $3.7 billion extension of Bay Area Rapid Transit that would stretch that rail link from San Francisco to San Jose.\n\nThe Bay Area's feel-good aura could work in its favor, especially in the turbulent world political climate, boosters say. ''The ugly reality is that there is a very anti-U.S. sentiment around the world,'' Mr. Winnicker said. ''We believe San Francisco can help overcome that stigma.''\n\nBut dissent, too, is part of the city's culture.\n\n''It's a more relaxed and open place to have an Olympics, if you have to have one,'' said Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the 73-year-old poet and founder of the City Lights bookstore in North Beach. ''It has become such a commercialized and jingoistic spectacle that the original classic idea of the Games has been totally corrupted. I'd rather watch the Giants.''\n\nCorrection:  November 2, 2002, Saturday  An article yesterday about San Francisco's campaign to be the host city for the 2012 Summer Olympics misstated remarks by a spokesman for the Bay Area Sports Organizing Committee in some copies, and misstated the amount the committee expects to set aside for athlete training after the Games. The spokesman, Tony Winnicker, said, ''San Francisco is one of the world's favorite American brands,'' not ''San Francisco as a brand is America's favorite.'' The committee expects the Games to generate a $400 million surplus, of which athlete training would get $170 million, not $1.7 million."

        "document": "North Korea today called off a planned visit by Japanese-born women to Japan, in a sign of steadily worsening relations between the two countries.\n\nNorth Korea's announcement, along with a series of denunciations of the ''Japanese reactionaries'' and their ''despicable smear campaign'' against the Communist Government in the North, apparently marked a suspension of a program begun last November to allow 1,800 Japanese-born women living in North Korea to return to their homeland for visits. Most of the women married ethnic Korean men in Japan and moved with their husbands to North Korea in the 1960's.\n\nMore broadly, the announcement today seemed to mark at least a temporary setback in the process of building ties between North Korea and its neighbors.\n\nJapan is crucial to any effort to draw North Korea into the international economy, and the plan to allow the Japanese-born women to visit Japan had been regarded as a major step in building trust between the two countries. But Japanese officials said they did not know precisely what to make of the announcement.\n\n''This announcement came all of a sudden, and we find it regrettable,'' said Sadaaki Numata, the chief Foreign Ministry spokesman.\n\nThe North's official Korean Central News Agency said the visits were called off because of ''artificial hurdles'' and ''inhuman acts on the Japanese side.''\n\nNorth Korea did not specify what these were, but the suspension came after Japanese officials again raised the case of at least 10 Japanese who officials in Tokyo say were probably kidnapped by North Korean agents and taken to North Korea over the years. The Japanese public has been embittered by the reports that Japanese were abducted, in some cases while walking along the beach, and smuggled to North Korea to serve as Japanese-language teachers or to allow their identities be taken over by North Korean spies.\n\nThe plight of Megumi Yokota, who was 13 when she vanished from the Japanese coast in November 1977, has particularly moved the Japanese public and created a major obstacle to any effort to improve relations. A defector from North Korea has said Miss Yokota was abducted and has been living in the North.\n\nNorth Korea announced a few days ago that it had conducted an exhaustive search for the 10 Japanese, checking birthdates and other information, but had found no sign of them. Yet instead of laying the issue to rest, as the North perhaps hoped, the investigation was immediately rejected by Japan.\n\n''We want to obtain some clues to this problem,'' Deputy Foreign Minister Shunji Yanai said on Monday, adding that Japan probably would not resume normalization talks with North Korea until there was some progress in finding the missing people.\n\nNorth Korea responded to Mr. Yanai today with a series of blasts and, apparently, with the suspension of the visits by the Japanese wives.\n\n''The Japanese reactionaries' sustained talk about 'suspected abduction' will only betray the miserable plight of Japan and invite public condemnation for Japan's playing into hands of the South Korean puppets,'' the English-language service of the Korean Central News Agency declared today.\n\nThe news agency added that ''Japan is a war criminal state which plunged Asia into disasters.''"

        "document": "The United Nations is warning this week that gains made with the emergence of dozens of democracies over the past decade now risk being reversed, with authoritarian leaders manipulating elections and millions losing faith in democratic systems.\n\nIn dozens of nations, democratic culture -- allowing room for political opposition, a free press and robust citizens' action groups -- is failing to develop or is being stifled, a report to be released on Wednesday concludes.\n\nThe study, ''Human Development Report 2002: Deepening Democracy in a Fragmented World,'' also found that economic slowdowns in many countries add to a popular perception that democracies cannot deliver better lives.\n\n''Since 1980, 81 countries have moved into the democratic column and, indeed, some 33 military governments have been replaced by civilian governments,'' said Mark Malloch Brown, administrator of the United Nations Development Program, which published the report. In comments to reporters last week, he added that 140 of about 200 countries have held multiparty elections.\n\n''The concern is that one multiparty election does not a democracy make,'' he said. ''The international cheerleaders for democracy have underestimated what it takes to build a functioning, properly rooted democracy.''\n\nThe program's annual Human Development Report was created in 1990 to measure the progress of nations not in dry economic statistics but in the lives of ordinary citizens. Over the objections of some governments, in rich as well as poor countries, the report has become increasingly pointed in its criticisms of political chicanery, corruption and human rights abuses.\n\nThe report ranks countries by quality of life, based largely on life expectancy, education and personal incomes. This year Norway ranks first, as it did last year, followed by Sweden, Canada, Belgium, Australia and the United States.\n\nThe countries at the bottom of the index are all sub-Saharan African. Sierra Leone, where life expectancy stands at barely 39 years, is worst, followed by Niger, Burundi, Mozambique and Burkina Faso. The report will be available at www.undp.org.\n\nChoosing democracy as its focus this year, the report concluded that although a majority of the world's people live in at least nominal democracies, in 106 countries political freedoms and civil rights are limited, and, since 1990, civil wars have cost 3.6 million lives. About 2.8 billion of the world's 6 billion people live on less than $2 a day. More than 60 countries have lower per capita incomes now than they did in 1990.\n\n''Democracy doesn't seem to be responding to the real agenda of the world's poor,'' Mr. Malloch Brown said. The report says that money politics serving special interest groups is of concern to voters in democracies as divergent as the United States, where corporate contributions rose to $1.2 billion in the 2000 election, and India, where 80 percent of funds for major political parties in a 1996 election came from large corporations.\n\nVoter turnout seems to be declining everywhere, the report found. Polls often show a dwindling confidence in democracy and the free market, most recently in Latin America, the report said. The failure of rich nations to expand free trade rapidly enough to make a difference to struggling economies is a factor in this, United Nations officials say.\n\nSometimes, the report found, new democratic hopes unmet by elected governments lead to public disgust for the system and regression to military rule. Experts often cite the example of Pakistan, where corrupt and inefficient elected governments in the 1990's were exposed and hammered by a free press. One result was little public opposition to the takeover of government by Gen. Pervez Musharraf in 1999.\n\nMore recently in Zimbabwe, a suspect election has contributed to a precipitous economic slide and laid the ground for political strife.\n\nLooking around the world, the 2002 Human Development report found banks, courts and government institutions under strain, often because of corruption or political pressures. It found electoral processes subverted by fraud and heavy-handed politics.\n\nPerhaps sensing their vulnerability, many governments are asking the United Nations Development Program for more help in handling law and order.\n\nThe organization, which is involved in training police officers in Afghanistan, Mozambique and Haiti, will spend 60 percent of its aid budget this year on supporting what is generally called ''good governance'' -- the proper functioning of democratic institutions, including parliaments. Only a few decades ago, the bulk of the money went to more traditional development projects like drilling wells or aiding local public services."

        "document": "The city of Quetta, Pakistan, has thrived down the centuries as a center for commerce on the ancient Silk Road and the home of tribal groups whose loyalties bowed neither to the sword of invaders nor to the demands of governments. The ruling Taliban in Afghanistan, whose border lies just 60 miles northwest, are mostly from the Pashtun ethnic group, which dominates political and business life in Quetta. The tribal link contributes to the backing here for the Taliban, though the depth of support is hard to gauge.\n\nQuetta today embodies the shifting passions and loyalties of Pakistan and its war-plagued neighbor.

My country is going to be destroyed again.\n\nLakmir Khan  Butcher, 24, in his shop on Zarghoon Road, Quetta, the city of his birth.\n\nQ. What are your thoughts on Americans?  A. They are very bad people because they are the enemy of Islam and they are killing innocent people.  Q. And on Osama bin Laden?  A. A holy warrior, a very important person for Islam. All he has been accused of is wrong. He has not been involved in a terrorist attack on the U.S.A.\n\nFaiza Sayar  A 40-year-old widow. Born in Herat, Afghanistan, now a refugee in Quetta.\n\nQ. How did you feel when you heard of the World Trade Center attacks?  A. I was nervous to see terrorism have this kind of power. I was worried of reprisals.  Q. The bombing in Afghanistan?  A.

        "document": "Alex Salmond, the newly elected first minister of Scotland, expressed concern Thursday that the British government had struck a deal that might permit the only person convicted in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing to return to Libya to complete his sentence.\n\nPrime Minister Tony Blair's office said it was ''totally wrong'' to suggest that a so-called memorandum of understanding on legal matters signed with Libya last week covered the case of the Libyan, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, who is serving a 27-year jail term in Scotland.\n\nHe was sentenced in 2001 for his part in the bombing of PanAm Flight 103 from London to New York, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people, 189 of them Americans.\n\nDespite the British denial, word of the convicted bomber's possible move to Libya stirred outrage and dismay among some of the relatives of those who died in the bombing, Britain's bloodiest terrorist attack.\n\nSusan Cohen of Cape May Court House, N.J., lost her only child, Theodora, when the Boeing 747 exploded on Dec. 21, 1988, and said she was getting calls from Scottish newspapers about the reported agreement. ''I really feel quite wretched,'' she said. ''We have no justice at all here.''\n\n''This is absolutely appalling if this happens,'' she said.\n\nMr. Salmond made the announcement at a special session of the Scottish parliament. He became first minister after regional elections in May that permitted his Scottish National Party to form a minority government in Edinburgh.\n\nHe said Mr. Blair signed the agreement on May 29 during a visit to Libya as part of a farewell tour of Africa before his planned resignation on June 27. Mr. Salmond noted that Mr. Megrahi had appealed the length of his sentence, while the Scottish authorities are appealing to extend it.\n\n''One obvious concern would be that this memorandum could be interpreted as having implications for that due process of law,'' Mr. Salmond said. The Scottish authorities, he said, had long received assurances that ''any sentence imposed would be served in Scotland.''\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Blair's office said: ''There is a legal process currently under way in Scotland reviewing this case, which is not expected to conclude until late this summer.\n\n''Given that, it is totally wrong to suggest that we have reached any agreement with the Libyan government in this case. The memorandum of understanding agreed with the Libyan government does not cover this case.''\n\nMr. Blair's office confirmed that the memorandum related to legal issues, including extradition, but said the details and reach of the agreement still had to be negotiated.\n\nMr. Megrahi, a Libyan intelligence official, was convicted 13 years after the bombing and 10 years after he was first indicted. Under a complicated international agreement, his trial, along with that of his co-defendant, Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, was held under Scottish law at a court in the Netherlands. Mr. Fhimah was found not guilty."

        "document": "The rivalry match at the United States Open fizzled, but the mismatch sizzled.\n\nAfter Lindsay Davenport defeated Venus Williams, 7-5, 6-4, in a match that was ho-hum until the last game, Nadia Petrova surprised top-seeded Justine Henin-Hardenne, 6-3, 6-2, in a fourth-round match at Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing Meadows last night.\n\nPetrova, seeded 14th, had taken only one set from Henin-Hardenne in five previous matches. It was supposed to be a brief climb through the bracket for Henin-Hardenne, who could have used the rest after a viral infection wiped out much of her season. Now she can take the whole week off.\n\nHenin-Hardenne, the defending Open champion, made 30 unforced errors, double-faulted four times and hit just 14 winners. Her most effective stroke, her one-handed backhand, betrayed her. She will lose her No. 1 ranking after the tournament, leaving Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo and Davenport to fight for the top spot.\n\nHenin-Hardenne's loss was the earliest exit for a woman seeded No. 1 since Billie Jean King lost in the third round in 1973. She recently won the gold medal at the Olympics in Athens but has dealt with lingering fatigue from the virus. ''I was very nervous and I couldn't come through,'' she said.\n\nPetrova, a 22-year-old Russian, has never won a Tour event. She has advanced beyond the fourth round in a Grand Slam tournament only once, when she reached the semifinals of the French Open in 2003.\n\n''I'm very satisfied,'' she said. ''I played great.''\n\nPetrova will meet Svetlana Kuznetsova in the quarterfinals. Kuznetsova defeated Mary Pierce, 7-6 (5), 6-2. Pierce, who collected a third-round upset victory over Maria Sharapova as a souvenir, pulled a groin muscle during the tie breaker. She has never advanced beyond the quarterfinals at the Open, but in the early rounds she showed flashes of the player who has won two Grand Slams and reached a ranking of No. 3 in 1995. Kuznetsova overpowered Pierce with 13 aces and 40 winners.\n\nIn the evening's earlier fourth-round match, all the emotion Williams crammed into staving off elimination against Davenport saved the 25th match in their rivalry from being a dud.\n\nBut it did not save the 11th-seeded Williams. On her fifth match point, Davenport blasted a serve down the middle and Williams lunged at it with her jittery forehand. The ball sailed long, sending Davenport into the quarterfinals.\n\nDavenport now holds a 13-12 lead in the series between them. She has won the last three encounters after losing the previous five.\n\nDavenport, who has won 21 consecutive matches, looked fitter, happier and calmer.\n\n''I felt O.K. until I lost about the second match point,'' Davenport said. ''And then you get a little, 'Oh, no, don't do this.'''\n\nWilliams elevated her grunting and her shot making in the last game, but Davenport, seeded fifth, said she kept telling herself that she was playing someone who was going to continue making mistakes. Williams had 42 unforced errors to Davenport's 20.\n\nThe often-injured Davenport holds a clear edge over the recently ailing Williams in the battle of comebacks. Davenport has won six tournaments this season, including her last four. Williams has won two.\n\nIt was an odd sight watching two of tennis's heavyweights slugging it out on center court with nearly a week left in a Grand Slam tournament. Nineteen of their previous encounters were either in a final or a semifinal.\n\nIn what could be a letdown for Davenport, she will play her quarterfinal match against unseeded Shinobu Asagoe of Japan. Asagoe, who has never won a singles title, defeated No. 29 Eleni Daniilidou of Greece, 7-6 (4), 4-6, 6-3.\n\n''For me, it's still a quarterfinal match and I have to take it like it's going to be tougher,'' Davenport said.\n\nWilliams, trying to recover from wrist and ankle injuries, said: ''I can't be hard on myself. I have to take my time and realize that it's just a matter of time before I'm playing my best.''\n\nFor most of the match, that time appeared far off. Williams seemed to wrestle with herself through every service game. But Davenport trailed in points on her serve just once and never faced a break point until the final game.\n\nAlthough Williams, a two-time champion here, insisted that she had enjoyed her time at the Open -- she missed it last year with an abdominal injury but made it at least to the semifinals in her six previous appearances -- she seemed to compete without joy. Her vigor returned only in a wild final game, which lasted 24 points.\n\nEach player seemed to tighten, but Williams worked through the tension. She unleashed a few passing shots to help save the first four match points and had five break points of her own.\n\nDavenport led the second set, 5-4, at the time, and Williams said the outcome might have been different had she been able to win the game. But she learned plenty, she said.\n\nThe last time the two met at the Open was in 2000, when Williams beat Davenport in straight sets for her first of back-to-back Open championships.\n\nThe tepid first set presented one pivotal moment, and Williams wilted in it. Trying to salvage a break point with the score at 5-5, Williams sent a forehand long to hand a 6-5 lead to Davenport. On her serve, Davenport closed out the set with a 107-mile-an-hour ace. The match seemed to be lurching to a predictable finish until the last game fired up the pro-Davenport crowd.\n\n''It was a good game because it was dramatic,'' Davenport said. ''It wasn't a good game because it was good tennis.''\n\nTENNIS"

        "document": "Next week the White House and Congress will consider whether the United States should punish foreign companies that do business with Cuba, Iran and Libya. Laws already prohibit American businesses from trading with these countries, but the Helms-Burton Act and the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act, both passed in 1996, go even further. They try to haul foreign companies into American courts and bar the companies' executives from entering the United States. These laws only irritate American allies. President Bush and the House Financial Services Committee should act to neutralize the laws and seek other ways to promote democratic change in partnership with other nations.\n\nTitle III of the Helms-Burton Act allows Americans to sue foreign companies whose operations in Cuba involve assets confiscated when Fidel Castro took over the country in 1959. Title IV of the act prohibits travel to the United States by executives from, for example, a Spanish hotel chain that manages properties in Cuba. If Washington wants companies in the European Union to cooperate in its isolation of Cuba, it should deal with the E.U.'s governing body directly. Moreover, Americans' claims to Cuban assets, while potentially legitimate, are exceedingly difficult to verify. While Title III enforcement has been delayed by presidential waiver, Title IV is in full force.\n\nThe Iran and Libya Sanctions Act bars the government from issuing trading licenses and financing assistance to any company with significant investments in Iran's or Libya's oil industry. These sanctions are difficult to enforce and are opposed by American allies. The act also applies the same sanctions to any company that trades in contravention of the United Nations sanctions against Libya. This is a laudable provision, since it strengthens the enforcement of internationally agreed policies.\n\nThe United States certainly has a right to isolate countries whose political regimes it opposes. One way to do this is to deny them access to the world's biggest import market and best selection of exports. But calling foreign companies to account for otherwise legal business conducted outside American borders goes a step too far. It forces countries to pick sides in a way that is more appropriate to wartime than to commerce, and so erodes the constructive role of America's traditional allies. Some of the countries affected by these laws -- including Canada, the members of the European Union and Mexico -- are among those that might one day help to broker an improvement in American relations with Cuba, Iran or Libya.\n\nTo the extent that new companies are scared off by the laws, they actually help those with established businesses in Cuba, Iran and Libya. And except for Title IV of the Helms-Burton Act, the laws in question have been virtually unenforceable. Consultations with other governments, such as the European Union, have been far more productive in curbing foreign business interests. Strict enforcement of the laws might also provoke the E.U. to reactivate an appeal to the World Trade Organization, which forbids withholding export licenses from law-abiding companies based in member nations.\n\nNext Tuesday the Clinton administration's waiver of Title III of the Helms-Burton Act will expire. President Bush should extend the waiver, and seek a waiver of Title IV. His announcement yesterday of new measures to strengthen the embargo of Cuba may have been meant to counterbalance the reaction to an extension. On Wednesday the House Financial Services Committee will begin the Congressional debate over whether to renew the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act, whose enforcement has also been delayed, for another five years. The committee should encourage Congress to abandon all sections of the act except those that strengthen the United Nations sanctions.\n\nCorrection:  July 17, 2001, Tuesday  An editorial on Saturday about trade sanctions incorrectly identified the Congressional committee that will take up the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act tomorrow. It is the Senate Banking Committee, not the House Financial Services Committee."

        "document": "After anchoring two sprint victories at the Penn Relays on Saturday afternoon, Marion Jones said in a news conference that she did not write a $7,350 check from her account to Balco in September 2000, and that she did not know at the time that the check had been written. She insisted that her name would be cleared in the near future.\n\nThe New York Times reported Saturday that a check from Jones's account was written to the founder of Balco, Victor Conte Jr., and deposited one week before the Sydney Olympics. Jones did not dispute that the check was from her account, nor did she deny other details in the article.\n\nBut she would not say who wrote the check. The Times reported that two people familiar with the check said that it was signed by her former husband, C. J. Hunter, a retired shot-putter. Hunter did not return telephone calls Friday or Saturday.\n\n''My stance on it is, that I have never signed, agreed, saw or sent any check to Balco,'' Jones said. ''Or knew about it.''\n\nAsked about who had written the $7,350 check and for what purpose, Jones said: ''I'm not in a position to make a comment on the other person, and I refuse to do so. I can't say what it might have been for. I don't know, I don't know anything about the check -- and that's pretty much all I can comment about that.''\n\nConte and three other men associated with Balco, the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative, have been charged by the federal government with distributing steroids and laundering money. The four have pleaded not guilty.\n\nJones, the winner of three gold medals at the 2000 Olympics, testified last fall before a grand jury investigating Balco. Her boyfriend, the sprinter Tim Montgomery, also testified. Both have denied using banned performance-enhancing drugs and neither has been accused of it. Last Sunday at the Mount SAC Relays in Walnut, Calif., Jones said, ''I'm drug free, always have been and always will be.''\n\nBut the check does link Jones to Balco and could offer an explanation for her testimony before the grand jury. Jones has said she has had a ''conversation or two'' with Conte but has never bought any products from Balco.\n\n''In terms of my association with Mr. Conte, I cannot comment on that at this point, obviously,'' Jones said. ''I did testify in front of the grand jury, that is public knowledge. Unfortunately, a lot of the media equates that to being guilty, and that's definitely not the case if you know the judicial process.''\n\nCraig Masback, the executive director of USA Track & Field, said, ''The sooner information comes out that clarifies the situation as to who's guilty and who's innocent, the better.''\n\nThe United States track and field Olympic trials begin July 9 in Sacramento.\n\nJones was asked whether she felt singled out. ''I think that the position that I am in, in the sport, my association with people in the past, perhaps has been in question,'' she said. ''But I don't think that people are out to get me.\n\n''If you really want to do research, you can just look at my improvement. When I've run faster and when I've run slower, that it's all in line with an athlete that's just working hard and that is talented.''\n\nTRACK AND FIELD"

        "document": "If you thought the hamburger, pizza and Evian prices at Arthur Ashe Stadium were as steep as its high-altitude seats, then consider the cost of chowing down within the expensive confines of the $254 million tennis palace's 90 luxury suites.\n\nThis is a story of big money and big fruit platters, a cautionary tale about the exercise of power by a sports organization bent on making its richest fans, domiciled in the 90 plush boxes, eat like sumo wrestlers at a Catskills hotel buffet.\n\nBy order of the United States Tennis Association, a suiteholder paying up to $110,000 for the 14-day United States Open (slightly more than what Boston Red Sox suites cost per 81-game season, according to Team Marketing Report) must buy $24,000 worth of food from Restaurant Associates, the in-house caterer of all things edible at the U.S.T.A. National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows.\n\nThe suiteholder is further prohibited from buying anything from any other food purveyor, no matter how repetitive the U.S.T.A.-sanctioned platters and baguettes may get. A smuggled-in Snapple, a bootlegged Schlotzky's sandwich -- all verboten.\n\nSteve Levkoff, who runs a $70 million business in Queens, ran afoul of the fiats and lost Suite 221.\n\n''It's wrong, it's trumped up,'' said Levkoff, the president of the Standard Group, a manufacturer of printed boxes for cookies, toys and cereals based in Jackson Heights. ''Somebody else wanted the suite.''\n\nJoe Favorito, a spokesman for the U.S.T.A., said, ''There were repeated warnings to him, and he never abided by the terms of the lease.''\n\nLevkoff is the only suiteholder not to be renewed for undereating or any other reason, Favorito added.\n\nSo now, after a love of tennis that dates to attending the United States Open at Forest Hills, Levkoff has sworn off the Grand Slam event and will not even watch the women's final when it is played in prime time for the first time. ''They've really jaundiced me,'' he said.\n\nSerial undereating, or, more precisely, underordering, from Restaurant Associates, led to his eviction.\n\nThe $24,000 figure is based on the estimated cost of one meal for every one of the 20 ticketholders in each suite for each of the 24 day and evening sessions, Favorito said.\n\nLevkoff figures that he and the clients he entertained at each tournament could conceivably consume $24,000 in food and drink, but he did not manage to. And he preferred not to eat dinner in the suite (choosing a stadium restaurant where his purchases did not count toward his suite tab), so his average lunch and snack bill has averaged a mere $7,500 a year since leasing the suite in 1997.\n\nHis final act of gustatory defiance came on Super Saturday last year, when he and his rebel noshers, clad in Hawaiian shirts, brought in assorted deli sandwiches -- a flagrant flouting of suite lease Rule 6(a), which effectively bars independent picnicking catered by outsiders.\n\n''Someone from Restaurant Associates saw it and made a big deal,'' he said. ''I admitted I was wrong.''\n\nAt Madison Square Garden, for example, suiteholders cannot bring in outside food but may buy as little or as much food as they desire from the arena's in-house caterer.\n\nTo rectify the financial havoc Levkoff caused with his unendorsed, unapproved grub, he said, ''They made me pay for food I didn't order.'''\n\nThe day's penalty: $1,089.91.\n\nIn her adieu to Levkoff, Suzanne Maguire, the director of United States Open Projects, wrote in March that she ''regrettably'' could not offer him the ''opportunity to renew this agreement'' -- citing the lessee's food obligations -- but that he could still renew his courtside box, which he never uses but lets an affiliated company enjoy the tickets.\n\nLevkoff might have had a better case had the suite leases been automatically renewable. But they were not, so at lease's end, each suiteholder must prove his worthiness.\n\nBeing a food scofflaw did not help Levkoff. He had given the authorities reason to wonder why he and his merry dieters were spending only $7,500. Then he offended further by spiriting in the forbidden deli.\n\nHe courted trouble and was whacked by the U.S.T.A. like Goran Ivanisevic serving to a pre-teen.\n\n''Legally, they can do what they want,'' he said. ''But it's such an abuse. I've been going there for 30 years, and it's wrong not to have any wiggle room.''\n\nBut, he said the $24,000 rule, which the U.S.T.A. told its suiteholders about in 1999, had not been applied to him. He said that Restaurant Associates never required him to pay a pretournament deposit of $18,000, based on the $24,000 minimum. If he were not billed the proper amount, Favorito said, ''he would have been one of the few.''\n\n''But he knew there was a $24,000 minimum,'' he added.\n\nLevkoff insisted that Maguire had privately told him that spending $7,500 per tournament would be O.K., but Favorito said that Maguire did not recall making the assurance.\n\nIn a letter to Levkoff in 1999, Maguire wrote that if the $24,000 minimum were not met, suiteholders would be ''assessed accordingly.''\n\nLevkoff said, ''No one enforced the rule or said, 'I'll throw you out if you don't meet the minimum.' ''\n\nIn the end, Levkoff's final, unpardonable sin was to go brown-bagging with fugitive deli food on that fateful day, Sept. 9, 2000.\n\nSPORTS BUSINESS"

The United States will be missing its captain, the midfield workhorse John Harkes, who must sit out because of accumulated yellow cards.\n\nAnd midfield, always a crucible in key games, will be especially important against Costa Rica. The Ticos have several exceptionally fast forwards and skillful midfielders, and in past games they have bedeviled the Americans by winning the ball and sending those forwards rocketing through on counterattacks.\n\nCosta Rica, playing at home last March, beat the United States, 3-2. Last December, in the previous stage of qualifying, the teams split two games. After Sunday, the United States has four games left, at home against Jamaica and El Salvador, and away at Canada and Mexico.\n\nHernan Medford and Paulo Wanchope are the dangerous speed demons. Wanchope is said to be injured, but both Sampson and Ramos said they would believe it only if they do not see him on field for Sunday's game (ABC, 3:30 P.M. Eastern).\n\nDefinitely missing, though, will be Costa Rica's captain, central defender Ronald Gonzalez, out because of a red card in the previous match, a costly 0-0 draw at home against El Salvador.\n\nThe Americans will be trying to convert their own speed -- and the skill of Ramos on the right side of the midfield and Ernie Stewart on the left -- to penetrate that defense.\n\n''We need to spread the ball out wide, because they'll be very focused on defending, since they're playing on the road and for a new coach,'' said Reyna, referring to Juan Luis Hernandez, an experienced Spanish coach who is Costa Rica's third head coach this year.\n\n''That's why I love having Tab back,'' said Reyna, who will play the offensive central midfield role. ''We have good players up front they have to concentrate on, and now Tab is another thing they have to worry about. They'll be keying on him because they know he can beat people one-on-one.''\n\nThe outside backs, too -- most likely to be Jeff Agoos and Eddie Pope -- will also have to make use of the wings to spread the play out, and send crosses toward the forwards.\n\nWho the forwards will be Sampson will not say until Sunday. Eric Wynalda, bothered by a groin injury for two months, seems fit but has not played competitively in that time.\n\nRoy Lassiter, who played professionally in Costa Rica for three seasons and relishes playing against the Ticos, will probably start. And both Preki Radosavljevic and Roy Wegerle have impressed Sampson this week in camp.\n\nSampson seems committed to staying with Marcelo Balboa and Alexi Lalas as central defenders, although neither is fast and Lalas has been struggling in Major League Soccer games recently.\n\nSOCCER"

Or at least the top-seeded Andres Gomez, the youngest and hottest player on the 35-and-over Nuveen tour.\n\nInstead, they had to settle for an entertaining match involving Connors and Jose-Luis Clerc, who knocked off both McEnroe and Gomez. Clerc clearly outplayed Connors at the start, but Connors, who will turn 44 on Sept. 2, wore down his 38-year-old opponent with sharply angled ground strokes and won, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2.\n\nConnors earned $50,000 and Clerc received $30,000. The five-day event drew a record 35,936 spectators over 10 sessions at the Westchester Country Club.\n\nLong one of the world's best clay-court players, Clerc certainly had a chance tonight against Connors on the clay surface here before a near-capacity crowd of about 3,500. But then Connors is at home on any surface, and had won this event during its first three years. ''Jimmy still moves unbelievably,'' Clerc said.\n\nConnors has been unbelievable on the Nuveen tour, winning 20 of the 29 events held since it began in 1993. Clerc has beaten him only twice in 12 matches, and both of those victories came when Connors had to default.\n\nNeither player has lost much since leaving the ATP Tour. This was not slam-bam serve-and-volley tennis, but an exquisite match of long rallies and spectacular shot-making.\n\nClerc, who won 25 titles on the ATP Tour and was ranked in the top 10 four times in the early 1980's, was the steadier player in the first set of what was essentially a two-hour baseline duel. Connors lost his service three times in the opening set, but he never lost it again, while breaking Clerc twice in both of the last two sets.\n\nTo do so, Connors had to turn aggressive, drilling ground strokes deep into both corners while attacking the net for put-away volleys.\n\n''I was willing to stay out there for two or three hours to win,'' Connors said later.

        "document": "The staid community of Washington ''think tanks'' has been trying over the last year or so to find new ways to capture the attention of a post-cold-war America, realizing that the only way they can change the world is to get somebody to listen.\n\nThe Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has hired a new president known for applying her scientific training to new, ''global'' issues like terrorism and the environment. And it has revamped its magazine, ''Foreign Policy,'' to look more like a literary magazine and to grab a broader audience..\n\nOver at the Brookings Institution, the new President, Michael H. Armacost, feared that the organization was too closely associated with the Democratic Party and that people were too busy to read its scholarly research. Mr. Armacost hired a centrist Republican to direct foreign policy studies. He is known for his quick mind and media savvy and has become one of Washington's most quoted experts. At the same time, Brookings is paring down its list of fellows and asking them to write shorter research summaries, or ''policy briefs,'' for Washington politicians and professionals.\n\nThe appointments of Jessica T. Mathews, 51, as head of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and Richard N. Haass, 45, at Brookings, are supposed to be part of each institute's answer for a new look, and desire for new financial support.\n\nMs. Mathews made her mark as an innovator. A former Washington Post columnist, she turned down a top job in the Clinton Administration to become Carnegie's president. While she is well-grounded in traditional areas and has served on the board of both Carnegie and Brookings, her appointment is emblematic  of the search for a new, more global rationale.\n\n''I don't think my appointment had symbolic value to the search committee,'' she said in her sunny, spacious office. ''But it clearly does to others,'' who have sent her hundreds of letters.\n\nIn part, she said, it is ''a sense that I don't have a traditional foreign-policy background,'' with a career-long effort to try to integrate new themes like the spread of nuclear weapons, human rights and the environment and new actors into foreign policy. And in part it is her ability, like Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, to break gender ceilings.\n\nThe changes at Brookings, which also has major divisions in economic and governmental studies, are less striking and more traditional. For the last 18 months Mr. Armacost has been engineering a quiet shake-up to make it more nonpartisan ''in a way that shapes the public agenda and is useful to policy makers,'' he said.\n\n''The public is looking for practical answers, not ideology,'' he added.\n\nAt a time when money for foreign policy is decreasing , whether in Congress or among charitable foundations, there is a new, competitive concentration on salesmanship -- getting the message pithy and quotable, for legislators and a wider, national audience.\n\nThe paradox, as Mr. Haass sees it, is that ''as the old paradigms are shifting and nothing has taken their place,'' the study of foreign policy by outsiders should be thriving, since Government officials are generally too busy to think.\n\n''But with the cold war over, there's less urgency, and interest in foreign policy is smaller than it's been in the last 30 or 40 years,'' he said.\n\nMs. Mathews said the main difficulty for the policy research groups, a problem Ms. Albright also faces, is that ''while there is general recognition that we're the indispensable nation, the question remains, 'Indispensable for what?' ''\n\n''But the one-answer answer isn't working, and without one answer in a sound-bite society, it's hard'' to articulate a rationale without the cold war's military imperative, she said.\n\nStarting as a science adviser to Congress with a Ph.D. in molecular biology, Ms. Mathews became director of issues and research in Morris Udall's 1976 presidential campaign, and then, at 30, created the Office of Global Issues in Zbigniew Brzezinski's National Security Council under President Jimmy Carter, where Mr. Armacost and Ms. Albright also served.\n\nHer mother, the late historian Barbara Tuchman, pushed her to write -- ''she said it's a muscle you need,'' Ms. Mathews remembered, ''and a way to learn to write is through journalism.'' After President Carter's defeat, she wrote editorials for The Washington Post for three years, then helped found the World Resources Institute, one of the first research institutions to focus on the environment and Government policy. When she left 11 years later, its staff had grown from 3 to 110, and taught her about institution-building, fund-raising and promoting research that affects Government policy.\n\nShe left to enter the the Clinton Administration as Deputy Under Secretary on Global Affairs, but quit in frustration after nine months. The size of the bureaucracy, its traditional training and emphasis on crisis management made it hard to concentrate on global issues.\n\n''It's the difference between a chronic illness and a severe one,'' she said. ''In Government, you think it's all about the cables you read, and it's hard to see that things are happening that are beyond your control.''\n\nIncreasingly, she argues, key actors are nongovernmental agencies or citizens' groups like Amnesty International and international institutions like the World Bank or the United Nations.\n\nOther institutions, like the Heritage Foundation or the Cato Institute, continue to thrive on more ideological grounds. This use of ideas as weapons crafted for political wars by ''combat intellectuals'' -- rather than ''nonideological tools to be employed by policy makers regardless of their political affiliation'' -- was the focus of a valedictory essay by  Charles William Maynes, after 17 years of running Foreign Policy, Carnegie's subsidized magazine.\n\nThe magazine's first issue under a new editor, Moises Naim, has just appeared, with shorter articles, summaries of key articles in foreign and foreign-language journals, more reviews of books published abroad, a new web site, and more photographs.  While Carnegie has a large endowment, raising funds is increasingly important as some traditional givers, like the Pew Charitable Trust, have stopped financing foreign-policy projects.\n\nMs. Mathews also wants to address ''this whole question of public attention to foreign policy, of which the shrinking pool of funds is a reflection.'' Polls show great public interest in foreign policy, ''while there's a complete disconnect between the polls and Congress,'' which is more isolationist. ''The problem is not the general public so much but Congress,'' she said. ''We have to really think about this.''\n\nBrookings is also thinking about where to downsize. On the Middle East or arms control, ''a lot of the conceptual work has been done,'' Mr. Haass said. ''It needs to be implemented, but that's insider work.'' He has encouraged some scholars to go into Government or do field work to re-energize themselves and favors shorter-term appointments.\n\n''I see Brookings as a place where you spend part of a career,'' he said. ''Maybe people shouldn't spend 40 years at a think tank.''"

        "document": "The more Americans know about the world, the more likely they are to favor diplomacy over punitive sanctions in dealing with troublesome foreign countries, a poll has found. Embargoes, they say, not only isolate the nations at which they are aimed but also hurt American business.\n\nWhen Americans lack information about a country, or when their leaders do not adequately publicize and explain their policy thinking, many fall back on long-established stereotypes of ''bad'' and ''good'' nations, the poll found. Judgments about how to deal with those nations are then made on those images.\n\nThe survey -- by First International Resources, a business consulting group, and the polling organization Penn, Schoen & Berland -- was done in two parts for the sake of comparison. A national sample of 995 average voters was made first, and then 176 knowledgeable ''elites'' working in government, academic life and research institutes were surveyed.\n\nThe full poll results are expected to be made public next week. The survey, based on interviews from Feb. 28 to March 21, focused primarily on attitudes toward economic sanctions on Iran, but when respondents were asked to name ''good'' and ''bad'' countries, the findings suggest that the attitudes apply to sanctions policy toward other nations.\n\nRespondents in the general public knew very little about Iran and the recent political changes there, including gains by moderates in parliamentary elections. Only 15 percent of them had heard about advances by Iranians who advocate reform; only 2 percent knew of the 1997 election of a more moderate Iranian president, Mohammad Khatami. Among more knowledgeable people, 58 percent had heard about the shifts toward moderation.\n\nBoth groups, however, were still instinctively unfavorable to Iran, based on its reputation for support of terrorism and Islamic militancy. Only Iraq outranked it on the enemies' list among the general population. But the elite respondents were far more likely to say that Iran had changed -- they ranked Serbia, Libya and Iraq as worse cases -- and that Iranian moderates should be helped. These more knowledgeable people also said that sanctions got in the way of dialogue with Iran.\n\n''Both the general public and the elites believe it is extremely important to keep channels of communication open with countries like Iran,'' the poll concluded, ''and that penalizing or isolating rogue countries is not the way to get them to change.''\n\nSanctions have been a major policy tool of the Clinton administration, whether imposed by the United States alone or through the United Nations. Other nations, including American allies in Europe, have been critical of long-running embargoes and other sanctions, saying that they rarely hurt dictators but can harm ordinary people. They also get in the way of international business, or create tensions when the United States tries to force other nations to adhere to its own trade and investment restrictions.\n\nRecently, an American embargo on Iran was eased to allow for importing certain goods like caviar, pistachios and Persian carpets -- a move of which 6 of 10 poll respondents in the general public were unaware. Sports exchanges that have taken place drew universal support in the poll, and 77 percent of average voters and 90 percent of the elite respondents said sanctions should be lifted if Iran responded favorably to an initial easing of the embargo.\n\nIn Congress, a small but widening movement is questioning the long-term value of inflexible embargoes. There are concerns that in Iraq, for example, a decade of sanctions may be strengthening the hand of Saddam Hussein while causing unacceptable hardships to the Iraqi people.\n\nRepresentative Tony P. Hall, Democrat of Ohio, was in Iraq last week to assess the cumulative effects of the comprehensive sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. He is expected to announce the results of his trip today.\n\nThe new poll found that while Americans continued to think that sanctions should remain a tool of foreign policy and that big business would from time to time have to make sacrifices because of embargoes, respondents in both groups preferred sanctions to be imposed through international organizations.\n\nThey also expressed concern about the use of sanctions if American jobs were at risk, and when presented with facts about American losses, were more likely to want sanctions lifted, or at least eased."

And Mr. Obasanjo, addressing reporters at the White House afterward, spoke generally of his hope that some accord could be reached on Mr. Taylor.\n\n''Nobody should, of course, condone any crime that anybody has committed, no matter how highly placed,'' Mr. Obasanjo said, indicating that he and Mr. Bush had discussed the issue.\n\n''The administration and Congress share a common goal,'' Mr. McClellan said. ''A way needs to be found for Charles Taylor to be held to account for the crimes that he has committed.''\n\nSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice also discussed Mr. Taylor in a meeting with Mr. Obasanjo earlier on Thursday, the State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said. Asked whether Ms. Rice had suggested that Mr. Taylor be sent to the special Sierra Leone court, Mr. Boucher said only that the issue of how to bring Mr. Taylor to justice was ''a matter of continuing discussion.''\n\nOn Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed a resolution calling on Nigeria to send Mr. Taylor to Sierra Leone to stand trial.\n\nIn late 1989, Mr. Taylor organized a rebellion in Liberia that gained a reputation for appalling violence. He became Liberia's president in 1997, though the fighting continued. Exiled in 2003, he was given shelter in Nigeria, in a deal involving Nigeria, the United States and African leaders."

        "document": "After four years, United Nations weapons inspectors are back in Iraq making unannounced visits to factories and other locations where illegal weapons may be manufactured, stored or documented. That is encouraging, and directly attributable to President Bush's efforts to bring Iraq into compliance with longstanding Security Council instructions to give up its unconventional weapons. But the work of the inspectors alone isn't going to disarm Iraq. That will require the active cooperation of the Baghdad regime. This weekend will bring the first clear indication of whether Saddam Hussein intends to work with the U.N. or defy it.\n\nAs Americans follow the intricate moves now being made on the Iraqi chessboard, they shouldn't lose sight of the ultimate objective, reaffirmed last month by the Security Council. Iraq has to get rid of its biological and chemical arms and missiles and the means to make them, and abandon its efforts to develop nuclear weapons. That can be accomplished in one of two ways. Iraq can make a full declaration of its weapons arsenal this weekend, and then work with the U.N. to destroy the arms. If it doesn't, the United States is likely to use military force to disarm Iraq. A peaceful resolution would be far preferable.\n\nThe inspectors can play a vital role. They can conduct spot checks on suspected weapons manufacturing and storage sites and follow up on any new information that Baghdad provides in the report it must make to the Security Council no later than Sunday. The inspectors can also make Mr. Hussein seem less intimidating to his own people. A surprise inspection this week of one of his presidential palaces made clear to Iraqis that their dictator can be challenged. While American pressure on Baghdad has yielded good results in recent months, President Bush's criticism of the inspection program this week seemed hasty and unfair.\n\nNo matter how tough and clever the inspectors are, however, there is no way a group of 100 or so arms experts in a California-size country like Iraq can discover whether substantial caches of illegal weapons have been hidden away beneath the desert, at army bases or in seemingly innocent commercial or residential buildings. For that, they will need cooperation from knowledgeable Iraqis.\n\nThe best way for Iraq to provide that cooperation would be to give the U.N. a full accounting of its weapons programs. The report due this weekend must provide details of all chemical and biological ingredients and processes that could be diverted to military use as well as a thorough inventory of actual weapons development programs.\n\nThat isn't all. The Bush administration was right yesterday to make clear that once this weekend's report has been filed, Iraq has the further obligation to take the inspectors to all relevant weapons sites and make the scientists and technicians who worked on these programs available to answer their questions. The world has run out of tolerance for further evasions and deceptions."

Like spending $100 million to buy a fashionable English Premier League team. Like spending $120 million on seven world-class players, which is nearly $100 million more than the other 19 E.P.L. clubs combined to spend on summer acquisitions.\n\nIf you happen to be ROMAN ABRAMOVICH, a 36-year-old Russian billionaire, life is good, and getting better at Chelsea -- or Chelski, as some tabloid newspaper wags have called the club.\n\nOn Sunday, Abramovich made the trip from the desolate Russian province of Chukotka, where he is the governor, to Anfield, where Chelsea started its E.P.L. season with a 2-1 victory over Liverpool. Coincidentally, it was JIMMY FLOYD HASSELBAINK, whom Chelsea is ready to jettison, who scored the game-winner against Liverpool. That was after Abramovich saw his club defeat MSK Zilina of Slovakia, 2-0, in a Champions League qualifier.\n\nFive new players were on the field for Chelsea on Sunday: GLEN JOHNSON, DAMIEN DUFF, GEREMI, WAYNE BRIDGE and JUAN SEBASTI\u00c1N VER\u00d3N. Veron, the Argentine midfielder acquired from Manchester United, scored the first goal for Chelsea. The club's most recent signing, ADRIAN MUTU, the Romanian striker acquired from Parma for a $26 million transfer fee, missed the match because his transfer has yet to be approved by Italian authorities.\n\nM.L.S.\n\nDallas, last over all in Major League Soccer, has lost striker JASON KREIS (seven goals, two assists) for the rest of the season. Kreis, who is only three goals shy of breaking ROY LASSITER's M.L.S. record of 88 career goals, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee when his foot got stuck in the turf at Dragon Stadium outside Dallas during last week's match against San Jose. ... The Earthquakes, the overall league leader with 37 points, lost striker BRIAN CHING when he ruptured his right Achilles' tendon at New England on Saturday. Ching is tied with LANDON DONOVAN for the team lead with six goals.\n\nNew England has a 1-5-6 record since May 24 and has not won a league match since June 28, though TAYLOR TWELLMAN leads the league in scoring with 13 goals and 4 assists for 30 points. ... Fading Columbus has not won in seven games (0-4-3) and is 0-6-1 on the road since April 19. ... Goalkeeper JOE CANNON, who played in France last season, is expected to join Colorado later this week.\n\nThe MetroStars played to their third straight draw Saturday and have gone to overtime in eight of their last nine games, 10 over all this season. CLINT MATHIS played perhaps his best game in months, while goalkeeper JONNY WALKER, who replaced TIM HOWARD, continues to impress with his superlative play; he was named the league's player of the week yesterday.\n\nW.U.S.A.\n\nAtlanta will play for the Women's United Soccer Association title for the second time in the three-year history of the league after it used a desperate comeback to defeat San Diego, 2-1, in overtime.\n\nALY WAGNER's first-half goal stood up until the second minute of stoppage time, when CONNY POHLERS scored from a scramble in front of the San Diego goal. The Spirit, which was trying to become the first W.U.S.A. team to play host to the championship game, looked spent. Four minutes into overtime, the Canadian international CHARMAINE HOOPER held off the exhausted defender JOY FAWCETT and slipped the ball past JENNI BRANAM for the winner.\n\nAtlanta will play Washington, which is playing in its second straight title match, on Sunday in San Diego. Washington's MIA HAMM and ABBY WAMBACH finished tied for the league's regular-season scoring lead, each with 33 points. Between them, Wambach (13) and Hamm (11) had 24 of the Freedom's 40 goals.\n\nU.S. UNDER-17 TEAM\n\nThere is a growing feeding frenzy in Finland over FREDDY ADU, the 14-year-old striker who has led the United States to the quarterfinals of the FIFA under-17 world championships. Adu, who has four goals in two games, is being pursued by Manchester United, according to reports in British newspapers.\n\nManager SIR ALEX FERGUSON has made personal contact with Adu's mother and ARNOLD TARZAY, his former coach and the family's adviser, according to The Observer. English Premier League and FIFA rules make it unlikely, however, that Adu would be able to play for a senior first team in Europe. Instead, he would probably have to play with youth teams until he turns 18. That would not be the case if he chose to stay in the United States and play in M.L.S.\n\nThe report on CNNSI.com said United States midfielder DANNY SZETELA, who is from Clifton, N.J., has received an offer from Everton of the E.P.L. Szetela is eligible for a Polish passport because his parents were born in Poland, which would make a transfer to a European club easier.\n\nON TV\n\nFor fans in the United States, television has long been the vast wasteland when it comes to soccer. No more.\n\nLast weekend in the New York metropolitan area, there were nearly a dozen matches broadcast live from around the world, the majority on cable. Three Major League Soccer matches; two Women's United Soccer Association playoff games; two from the German Bundesliga; one each from the English Premier League, Spain, Mexico and the A-League in the United States. There were also a handful of matches on tape delay from the Netherlands, Brazil, Argentina and France.\n\nGalavision, a Spanish-language network, had Adu and the under-17 world championship to itself.

Ranked fourth in the world, she had been in a slump since clinching the sole United States women's slot in the Games in December.\n\n''I'm getting faster, but I still have some things to figure out at the top,'' she said. The women's team was first rocked by an injury to Noelle Pikus-Pace, last year's World Cup champion, who was accidentally run over by a bobsled in October.\n\nThen came the public revelation of sexual-harassment accusations against Tim Nardiello, the coach. That led the United States Olympic Committee to bar him from coaching the team at the Games. The United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation fired Nardiello for insubordination on Feb. 4, after he flew to Europe and tried to coach the team anyway.\n\nThe men's team then lost its top competitor, Zach Lund, after he tested positive for the banned substance finasteride, which can be used as a steroid masking agent. Although the Court of Arbitration for Sport said it believed Lund had taken the drug only as an antibaldness medication, it still barred him for one year.\n\nLund was ranked No. 1 in the world before he failed the drug test, but the Americans' second-best slider, Eric Bernotas, posted the fastest time on Wednesday and is considered a medal contender.\n\nHAYS PICKS A BRAKEMAN -- Todd Hays of the United States chose the brakeman Pavle Jovanovic to push the two-man bobsled for him in this weekend's competition.

        "document": "Turkey reassured the United States today that despite its decision to receive a high-ranking Iraqi official, it will continue allowing American warplanes to use a base in Turkey for attacks on Iraq.\n\n''It is a decision made by Parliament, and only the Parliament can change that,'' Foreign Minister Ismail Cem told reporters in Ankara. ''The Government cannot do anything about it and does not have the intention, in any case.''\n\nThe Clinton Administration has expressed displeasure at the Turkish announcement that Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq would arrive here on Monday for talks. The visit will be made as the United States seems to be making headway in its efforts to isolate the Iraqi Government.\n\nMr. Aziz's visit is part of an Iraqi campaign to break out of that isolation. In recent days, Foreign Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahaf has visited Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia bearing letters to their leaders from President Saddam Hussein. Mr. Sahaf is expected to visit other Arab and African countries soon.\n\nTurkish leaders have told their American allies that they are not seeking to undermine United States policy toward Iraq. They say that as a neighbor of Iraq they have to maintain contact with the Government there.\n\n''It's natural to try to broaden our ties with our neighbors,'' Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said at a news conference.\n\nHe will offer ''constructive proposals'' to Mr. Aziz, he said, but did not elaborate.\n\n''Those who are worried about this meeting will see their concerns are unfounded,'' Mr. Ecevit said.\n\nAmerican military planes based at Incirlik in southern Turkey have been regularly attacking Iraqi positions in response to Iraqi violations of the no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq.\n\nSeveral Turkish leaders including Mr. Ecevit have suggested that they are uncomfortable with the steady raids.\n\nThe United States and Turkey are NATO allies and cooperate closely on a host of military and political issues.  But there is growing resentment that American policymakers have not consulted Turkey more fully on issues related to Iraq. Turkey was a member of the allied coalition in the Persian Gulf war, but has not been pleased with United States policy toward Iraq since the war ended.\n\nBefore the war, much of southeastern Turkey lived from border trade with Iraq. Most of that trade has been cut off because of trade sanctions that the United Nations has imposed on Iraq. Turkey has lost billions of dollars, and thousands of families in the border area have lost their livelihoods.\n\nTurkish leaders are also unhappy about the American role in creating and sustaining a Kurdish haven in northern Iraq. They say it has become a sanctuary for Kurdish guerrillas who operate in Turkey, as well as an unwelcome model for Turkish Kurds, who would like a self-governing enclave of their own.\n\n''The Turks want to be players, and they don't want to give Iraq the sense that they are 100 percent beholden to the Americans,'' a senior European diplomat based in Ankara said. ''They're suffering economically from the sanctions, and they're living next to a mad dictator who's being bombed every day and who might strike out against his neighbors. There's a feeling of insecurity in the neighborhood. It's very natural that they should want to take Iraq's pulse and see if they can start a dialogue.''\n\nTurkish military commanders, who traditionally support close ties with the United States, would probably oppose any effort to move the country closer to Iraq. Their concerns have been underlined in recent days by a debate over the new Iraqi Ambassador to Turkey, Faruk Hejazi. News reports have identified Mr. Hejazi as a former top official of the Iraqi intelligence service.\n\nMr. Aziz's planned visit to Turkey has become a major topic of political and diplomatic speculation here, and news commentators have focused on it. One called it ''no ordinary diplomatic event.'' Another, referring to the negative reaction from Washington, said, ''This is not exactly a crisis, but the atmosphere has certainly been stirred up.''"

        "document": "The terrorism trial that opened yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan presents an extraordinary challenge to the impartial administration of justice in the United States. The four defendants are accused of participating in a homicidal conspiracy of terror against the United States during much of the last decade, including the 1998 bombing of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Because the attacks were so repugnant, and the defendants are foreign-born, the prosecutors and the court bear a special obligation to insure that the case is handled fairly and in full compliance with the rights that must be accorded to every defendant in a criminal case.\n\nThe need for extra vigilance should not be underestimated, given the brutal nature of the crimes and the breadth of the conspiracy outlined by the government. Two of the defendants are charged with directly assisting in the embassy bombings, which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injured more than 4,000. The other two are accused more broadly of involvement in a global conspiracy spanning Asia and Africa that prosecutors say is directed by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile now believed to be living in Afghanistan. In their opening statement to the jury yesterday, prosecutors linked the conspiracy to the 1993 ambush of American troops in Somalia in which 18 soldiers died.\n\nThe government indicted 22 men, including Mr. bin Laden, on charges of participating in the international conspiracy. Only two others, besides the four on trial, are in American custody. One pleaded guilty. The other is likely to be tried later. Even so, the current trial is based on more than 100 pages of charges and is expected to last 9 or 10 months and involve more than 100 witnesses from six countries.\n\nThe proceedings have already generated unusual and difficult questions for the presiding judge, Leonard B. Sand, who has a long and distinguished record of protecting the rights of defendants. Last week he decided to allow prosecutors to use statements given overseas by three of the defendants, including a confession, even though the suspects were not offered lawyers at the time they were questioned. Judge Sand, ruling orally from the bench to expedite the case, said he was satisfied that the statements made by the defendants were voluntary, not the product of any coercion.\n\nBut under the Supreme Court's 1966 Miranda decision, the standard that American courts use to determine if statements are voluntarily given and thus admissible as evidence, suspects must be informed of their right to legal representation before they are interrogated. As the Supreme Court reaffirmed last year, interrogations in police custody can be inherently coercive, even in the absence of explicit threats or violence. We are troubled by Judge Sand's decision to deviate from strict adherence to the Miranda rule because the interrogation took place in a foreign country, Kenya, that makes no provision for legal representation. But we also understand the problem that any judge would confront in a terrorism case in determining whether providing a lawyer was feasible under the circumstances overseas. We await a written ruling that details Judge Sand's reasoning.\n\nJudge Sand and the prosecution team must make every effort to preserve the rights of the defendants. Terrorists attack physical targets for political ends. In this case, nothing would suit Mr. bin Laden more than to see the United States betray its judicial principles by failing to give the defendants a fair and just trial."

Shakah, abruptly announced his resignation in protest against what he said was Palestinian leaders' failure to stop his city's slide into chaos.\n\nIn Nablus, the Palestinians' commercial center and home of their stock exchange, armed men presenting themselves as freedom fighters are establishing control as the governing Palestinian Authority crumbles. They have taken to seizing hostages for ransom and extorting money from local businessmen.\n\nLast fall, gunmen killed the brother of Mr. Shakah, who once said in an interview that he had dreamed, before this conflict began more than three years ago, that his city would rank with Paris, London, or Washington. Nablus is ancient, built by Romans near the remains of a Canaanite city.\n\n''I see my city collapsing, and I don't want to stand idly by and watch this collapse,'' Mr. Shakah told The Associated Press on Friday. He was also quoted as referring to the Israelis, saying, ''I don't deny the role of the occupation in destroying the city through the frequent invasions, but we as an Authority and as citizens are doing nothing to protect the city.''\n\nFor most of the last two years, Israeli forces have prevented armed, uniformed Palestinian policemen from working in cities like Nablus, saying they often proved to be terrorists.\n\nMr. Shakah is a senior member of Yasir Arafat's Fatah movement and has been a close ally of Mr. Arafat in the past. He said he would remain in his job until May 1 to finish several projects, including a shopping mall.\n\nSeeking to hold off restive members of Al Fatah, Mr. Arafat promised Friday to call elections within a year for positions in the movement. Younger members have chafed at what they call corruption and mismanagement by longtime officials of the group. The Fatah leadership is dominated by the so-called Tunisians, officials who returned with Mr. Arafat from exile in Tunis in 1994. Fatah politicians who have lived longer in the occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip feel underrepresented.\n\nAlso Friday, the Israeli Army reported finding a tunnel almost 200 feet long that it said two Palestinian gunmen used Thursday to enter an Israeli-run industrial zone in the northern Gaza Strip, where they killed an Israeli soldier. Both Palestinians were shot to death on Thursday.\n\nThe army said soldiers had found a Palestinian police uniform inside the tunnel, which it said originated near a Palestinian police outpost in a warren of dozens of Palestinian commercial stalls. Soldiers razed the stalls.\n\nThe industrial zone remained closed on Friday.\n\nIn the southern Gaza Strip near the settlement of Kfar Darom, a Palestinian on a bicycle was approaching the settlement's greenhouses when soldiers demanded that he stop, the army said. He then blew himself up.\n\nIslamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nIn Jerusalem, Israeli police officers in stated pursuit of stone throwers stormed the square outside Al Aksa mosque, on the man-made plateau revered by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and by Jews as the Temple Mount.\n\nPalestinians said the police had not been provoked. But a police spokesman said the Israeli forces had been trying to stop a Palestinian riot and protect worshipers at the Western Wall, below the plateau. He said two rocks had landed on the plaza of the Western Wall.\n\nThe police fired rubber-coated steel balls and threw stun grenades. A few light injuries were reported on both sides.\n\nDemonstrations continued Friday against Israel's construction of a barrier against West Bank Palestinians. On Thursday, Israeli forces shot two Palestinians to death and wounded dozens more after protesters threw stones during a demonstration at the village of Biddo.\n\nOn Friday, Israeli forces fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators in the village of Qibya and just south of there in Budrus. In both cases the Israelis acted after Palestinian teenagers threw stones toward Israeli positions at the end of peaceful demonstrations. No injuries were reported.\n\nIn the shooting on Friday night, an Israeli man and woman were driving near the so-called green line that separates Israel and the West Bank when they came under fire, an army spokesman said. He said the car had been near the settlement of Eshkolot, but on the Israeli side of the boundary. Israeli forces were searching the area late Friday night."

        "document": "WHEN John Glenn returns to space tomorrow he will behold a humbling view of Earth that few have savored. John McConnell can appreciate the old astronaut's perspective, and he doesn't even have to leave his apartment in Ridgewood, Queens. In a corner of his kitchen is a flag emblazoned with the Big Blue Marble. Next to it lies the instrument panel that guides him through his favorite space: cyberspace.\n\nThe computer lets Mr. McConnell circle the globe before the space shuttle reaches orbit. His mission? To urge others to save the planet by becoming Earth Trustees, individuals whose choices about life and ethics will usher in an era of global peace and cooperation. This is not a stretch for him, since Mr. McConnell, 83, was also the brains behind Earth Day, the eco-fest first celebrated in San Francisco on March 21, 1970. This year it was celebrated on the Mir Space Station, among other places.\n\nDespite the popular misconception, Earth Day was not intended to be some hippie-dippy hazy holiday. Mr. McConnell, the son of a traveling preacher, is spiritual and serious about its implications. He thinks society has the technology to bring people together, even if only virtually at first.\n\n''We keep trying to move in the direction of those goals,'' said Mr. McConnell, whose Web site is www.earthsite.org. ''Actions, good or bad, begin in the mind. If we want to resolve conflict and rejuvenate our planet, we need people to be enthralled and have a sense of wonder of our amazing world.''\n\nAll this started while he was gazing into space many years ago. As a child, Mr. McConnell was awed by the stars that shimmered in the night. His religious upbringing helped pique his curiosity about essential questions of humanity. Those varied impulses converged in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik. ''In the context of the cold war, that was terrifying,'' said Mr. McConnell, who published a newspaper in North Carolina at the time. ''Everybody had the jitters with that Sputnik up there.''\n\nHe wrote an editorial proposing a peaceful satellite, a Star of Hope that would be visible from Earth as it flashed at the rate of a baby's heartbeat. The idea was published in other newspapers and led to a meeting with President Eisenhower.\n\nThe satellite was never launched, but he was now on a new trajectory. He devised ''A Minute for Peace,'' public service television announcements that urged people to set aside a moment each day to ponder how they could improve the world. But why stop there? By the late 1960's, he had moved to New York and embraced the world itself when he came up with Earth Day.\n\n''What brings people together is their local holidays,'' he said. ''Every country has holidays. What we needed was a holiday for the whole planet.''\n\nThe goals he set for Earth Day live on in the Earth Magna Charta, in which he outlines his current campaign for Earth Trustees. It requires no change from your pocket, only a change of heart.\n\n''Simply stated, every individual and institution on our planet should join in choosing what will eliminate pollution, poverty and violence,'' he said. ''To do this, we have to address the issues in ecology, economics and ethics.''\n\nWHILE he and his wife, Anna, would prefer to be living among the redwoods of California, they do what they can east of Eden, in Queens. They keep in touch with like-minded people through their computer and have amassed an impressive archive of documents, videotapes and other records of their decades in environmental work. While their apartment is tucked among a row of brick houses that face an asphalt playground, they grow herbs and vegetables in a small garden behind the kitchen.\n\n''Everyone has to make compromises,'' he said. ''If you want your efforts to count, though, you must make contact with other individuals.''\n\nThat explains his other compromise: living in Queens.\n\n''This is the last place I would live,'' he admitted. ''The only reason I'm here is because of my greater opportunity to influence the United Nations.''\n\nHe often visits representatives of international organizations to promote his ideas. Now if he could persuade someone with big bucks to launch the Star of Hope.\n\n''It would have progress reports from around the world on the progress they're making as Earth Trustees,'' he said. ''It would be a great way to usher in the new millennium: an outrider of planet Earth.''"

        "document": "SNOW DAY -- Most major airlines moved quickly yesterday to assure passengers with travel plans today in the Northeast that penalty fees for changing flights would be waived. United Airlines, for example, dropped fees for changing flights to or from airports from Washington to Maine for tickets bought before yesterday. Delta Air Lines, US Airways and JetBlue Airways also dropped fees for changing flights affected by the storm. Other airlines were expected to issue similar waivers as the snowstorm started affecting airports throughout the Northeast early last night. Airlines said information would be available on their Web sites. Early last night, airports in the New York area were reporting delays of up to three hours, and the backups were starting to ripple through the air-traffic system, with growing delays in major airports like Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta and O'Hare in Chicago.\n\nFLAME OUT -- Passengers cannot carry cigarette lighters on airplanes anymore. The Transportation Security Administration yesterday added all lighters to its list of items that are prohibited beyond airport security checkpoints. Each passenger can still carry on up to four books of safety matches. The reasoning is that lighters can be used like little blowtorches, while matches cannot. Matches and lighters of all kinds remain prohibited from checked bags.\n\nSOUTHWEST HAS A DEAL FOR YOU -- Southwest Airlines yesterday introduced a technology called Ding that flashes information on exclusive airfare deals to customers on their personal computers or laptops. Southwest says Ding is more immediate and faster than the e-mail alerts now used by airlines. The software can be downloaded from the airline's Web site, www.southwest.com.\n\nONLINE GUIDE TO OPULENCE -- Wading into the world of online hotel booking and rate information, Five Star Alliance opened a Web site yesterday devoted to luxury hotels around the world. The site, www.FiveStarAlliance.com, offers the ability to book rooms. ''Travelers want to be able to make informed choices, and luxury hotels want greater control over their brand and business,'' said Eric Koefoot, the chief executive of Five Star Alliance. He said the site -- which lists more than 1,000 luxury hotels -- provides an alternative to ''generic megasites'' that offer undifferentiated listings.\n\nWORLD AIR TRAFFIC SURGES -- Worldwide airline passenger traffic increased 7.9 percent in January from a year earlier, the International Air Transport Association said yesterday. The increase was ''stronger than expected,'' said Giovanni Bisignani, director general of the association, which predicted overall growth of 5.9 percent this year. Still, the United States airline industry has not benefited from the surge because of fierce fare competition. Yields, defined as pennies of revenue per mile flown by paying passengers, dropped 7.7 percent for domestic traffic in January, compared with a year earlier, said the Air Transport Association, a domestic trade group.\n\nJOE SHARKEY\n\nBUSINESS TRAVEL"

Women compete in balance beam, floor exercise, uneven bars and vault.\n\nToday's gymnasts wear leotards or exercise pants to train and compete, but in ancient Greece they did without -- without anything, that is. The root of the word gymnastics is the Greek word gymnos, which means naked, and that is exactly how men worked out back then. They practiced their sport in gymnasiums, which doubled as centers for the study of philosophy, music and literature.\n\nThe foundation for gymnastics, however, dates further back than ancient Greece. It can be traced thousands of years, as evidenced by the depiction in Egyptian hieroglyphics and Chinese art of gymnasts doing backbends and tumbling.\n\nSince then, it has transformed into one of the most popular Olympic sports, with gymnasts like Mary Lou Retton and Nadia Comaneci two of the most memorable names in Olympic history.\n\nMen's artistic gymnastics made its Olympic debut in 1896. Women began competing in the Games in 1928.\n\nAt the 2000 Olympics, six gymnasts were on a team and five competed in each event, with only four scores counting. This time around, however, there will be no room for error, particularly in the team finals. The preliminaries will use the same format as in 2000, but in the team final, only three athletes from each team will perform on each apparatus, with all three scores counting. Now, with a single fall off the balance beam, a wobbly dismount on the pommel horse or a step out of bounds during the floor exercise, a team could go home empty-handed.\n\nFor the first time in an Olympics without a boycott, the United States' men's and women's teams are medal contenders.

They are heavily favored to win the gold in Athens.\n\nThe national all-around co-champions Courtney Kupets and Carly Patterson will lead the women's squad.

They bypassed the doping agency's arbitration appeals process and went straight to the top sports court.\n\nA decision by the panel of three arbitrators from the court, the Court of Arbitration for Sport, cannot be appealed by Montgomery or track and field's governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations.\n\nThe doping agency has in its protocols the alternate recourse for athletes to go directly to the court, which has 150 members from around the world. But Montgomery is the first to take this direct route.\n\nThe doping agency has called for a lifetime ban of Montgomery, the world-record holder in the 100 meters, based on evidence it has from the federal investigation of Balco, the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative. But Montgomery's lawyers have contended that the evidence is inconclusive and unauthentic and that reports of the case could be tainting potential arbitrators.\n\n''It has been in the media every day in the United States, and that's certainly a factor,'' one of Montgomery's lawyers, Howard Jacobs, said in a telephone interview yesterday.\n\nHe said that the cases pending against the other athletes charged would most likely end up in the Court of Arbitration anyway, and this is just accelerating the process.\n\nIn a statement, Jacobs explained other reasons for the decision: ''We are taking this step because we believe that U.S.A.D.A.'s conduct -- including the use of questionable documents it characterizes as evidence, the use of an indicted and embittered individual as his chief accuser, the repeated leaking of confidential information, and U.S.A.D.A.'s ever-fluid standards of proof -- has been so egregious as to remove any confidence that Tim could be fairly treated in this process,'' he said.\n\n''By turning to C.A.S., we hope that Tim will have the best opportunity to clear his name in a fair and impartial proceeding.''\n\nJacobs's citing of Montgomery's ''chief accuser'' was a reference to Victor Conte Jr., the founder of Balco, who was indicted on federal charges of supplying performance-enhancing drugs. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nAll 18 athletes who have gone through arbitration with the anti-doping agency have received a sanction. Before the arbitrators for C.A.S. -- one picked by the athlete, another picked by the agency and the third picked by C.A.S. -- can proceed, Jacobs said the matter of burden of proof had to be decided. The agency claims that the panel has only to find ''comfortable satisfaction,'' which is prescribed in the new World Anti-Doping code, adopted by the I.A.A.F. in March.\n\nBut Montgomery is accused of something that took place more than three years ago, and therefore, his lawyers argue, the burden of proof should be ''beyond a reasonable doubt.''\n\nOLYMPICS"

        "document": "GABRIEL TORRES is an 18-year-old senior at Bulkeley High School in Hartford who immigrated from Argentina with his parents four years ago.  Though Torres never played tennis until he arrived in America, he is now ranked No. 95 among the 300 boys in the 1999 New England 18 Singles Standings by the United States Tennis Association/New England and is likely to attend college on a tennis scholarship next year.\n\n''Gabriel works very hard every day because he knows that this is his way out,'' said Carlos Aldave, Torres's Bulkeley tennis coach.\n\nTorres and thousands of other boys and girls have learned how to play tennis at one of the free clinics put on by the Greater Hartford Youth Tennis Association at Goodwin Park. Torres attended a clinic during his first summer in the United States in 1996.\n\nCoach Aldave, a Bulkeley High School social studies teacher, and the school librarian Rita McCarthy started the association five years ago at the high school to improve the prospects of children from low-income Hartford families through tennis and educational activities.\n\n''I think it's a great program,'' said Mayor Michael P. Peters of Hartford. ''From its beginnings as a high school tennis club through its evolution into providing tennis and academic mentoring and tutoring activities, the organization has been a positive force for Hartford's youth.''\n\nThe organization is sponsored by the Yonex Corp., a tennis equipment manufacturer, and funded by private groups such as the Knox Foundation, a Hartford civic foundation. It provides free tennis lessons to hundreds of children during the fall and summer. The program also offers children group lessons during the indoor season at The East Hartford Racquet Club, its official tennis center. And, it provides United States Tennis Association tournament and travel expenses, academic tutoring, career counseling and mentoring, and help with college applications, essays and entrance exams.\n\nIn 1999, more than 1,000 children between the ages of 4 and 18, most living below the poverty level, participated, much to the credit of Coach Aldave.\n\nAldave, 44, was born in Peru. His father, Juan Aldave, didn't speak English. He picked tobacco during the summer and worked two to three jobs to support his family. Coach Aldave, who grew up in city's North End, added to the family income by washing dishes from 6 to 10 p.m. at a local restaurant while he was a student at Northwest Catholic High School in West Hartford.\n\n''A lot of the kids are growing up in the same situation,'' Aldave said. ''It's very, very hard just to pay the bills and learn the language and culture.''\n\nAldave's father was very grateful for the way his son was helped by volunteers at such organizations as the Boy Scouts. (Coach Aldave became one of the first Hispanic Eagle Scouts in Connecticut.) And, he wanted his son to repay the debt he felt they owed the Hartford community. So Juan Aldave asked his son before he died in 1985, ''What are you doing to help kids the way you were helped?''\n\nAldave's answer: tennis. And, he based the Greater Hartford Youth Tennis Association's mission on something he once heard the late United States tennis champion Arthur Ashe say: you can change lives and reclaim spirit through tennis.\n\nTorres, who has been offered tennis scholarships by Sacred Heart University in Fairfield and Mitchell College in New London, is far from the only student to be lifted by the association. Srdan Banjac, a 16-year-old Bulkeley sophomore had dreamed of being a professional tennis player before he became a Bosnian refugee in 1992 at the age of 9. Yet when he fled Sarajevo with his mother, a doctor, his father, a film producer, and his younger sister Barbara, Banjac didn't know if he would survive, let alone play tennis and be happy again.\n\n''He thought that this was the end of his dreams and his childhood,'' Srdan's mother, Dr. Ljiljana Banjac, said.\n\nIn November 1998, after a six-year stay in Germany, Srdan Banjac and his family moved to Hartford and Banjac began his freshman year at Bulkeley. He was lonely and lost until he met Coach Aldave, who invited him to join Bulkeley's tennis team and the Greater Hartford Youth Tennis Association.\n\nBanjac attended a tennis camp this past summer and another one at  over Christmas vacation. Srdan received full scholarships to attend camp and he made many friends.\n\n''If he would not have been involved in tennis I would be very afraid for him,'' Dr. Banjac said. The association, she said, has made her son feel comfortable in this country.\n\n''In Srdan's case,'' Aldave said, ''if you talk about reclaiming spirit, he was in war, and he has had family members who died in war, and he's had bullets that were flying through his house. The Greater Hartford Youth Tennis Association has been able to brighten his spirits again.''\n\nAdrian Cosma, a Romanian immigrant, is another student positively affected by the program. ''It's  changed my whole life around,'' Cosma, a Bulkeley senior, said.\n\nCosma has been offered partial tennis scholarships to attend Mitchell College and Central Connecticut State in New Britain. Without a scholarship, he would be financially unable to attend college next year.\n\nA decade ago, when Aldave was considering taking the position of boys tennis coach at Bulkeley, a friend told him, ''Don't do it. City kids can't play a country club sport.'' But, Aldave accepted the job and the challenge in 1992.\n\nAlthough Aldave had been a head women's basketball coach at the University of Hartford, he said he chose tennis rather than basketball to help his Bulkeley students because he saw how defeatist they were.\n\n''They would ask me, are we going to get humiliated or is it going to be close,'' Aldave said.\n\nAldave's players didn't have the money for the private tennis lessons that some of their more affluent opponents had. Nor could they afford the equipment. The Bulldogs didn't win a single league match from 1990-1994. But, Coach Aldave said, ''I knew that the kids had everything they needed to be successful, and that if they were given the adequate resources, they could do as well as any kids.''\n\nAldave enlisted the help of Ben Bishop, the tennis pro and manager at the the East Hartford Racquet Club. Bishop, who became the director of tennis for the association, worked with the team on their strokes during the off-season. With his coaching and Aldave's strategy tips, the Bulldogs won their first league tennis championship last spring and finished fifth in the state in the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference Class L (large school) division.\n\nThe association now has five ranked players in the boys 18 and under division, more than any other town in Connecticut, something that Aldave is proud of.\n\n''Our community is no different than any other community,'' Aldave said. ''When our kids are given the opportunity and the resources, they prove that they can not only compete but be some of the best.''\n\nIn the fall of 1999, the association  consolidated its programs into three groups: the Advantage Education Program, the Tennis Center Programs and the College Prep Center.\n\nWhile Aldave concentrates on the tennis programs, McCarthy is the treasurer of the association and writes grants and reports. She also helps students prepare for the SAT and schedules speakers for the prep center.\n\n''It's been fun to see kids learn how to be good at a sport at a young age,'' McCarthy said. ''Seeing them develop their tennis skills and develop as young people has really given me a lot of satisfaction.''\n\nThe Advantage Education Program consists of twice-weekly group tennis lessons at The East Hartford Racquet Club, and twice-weekly academic help at Bulkeley. The Tennis Center Programs are year-round junior development programs.\n\nSaid Coach Aldave, ''It makes me proud that we can enhance a child's life not only for the present but also for the future.''"

        "document": "This may not quite be Taylor Twellman's dream season, his first in Major League Soccer, but it is a long way from his European nightmare.\n\nTold that his club team of two years, TSV 1860 Munich, had been knocked out of a European competition last week by a little-heralded club from Belarus, all Twellman could muster was, ''You can tell I'm not too concerned with that.''\n\nThese days, Twellman's aspirations are focused on the struggling New England Revolution. He has done his part by scoring 13 goals and and adding 2 assists in 17 games to lead the league in scoring. At 22, Twellman is one of the best players on one of the league's worst teams.\n\nNew England (6-10-1, 19 points), comes to Giants Stadium today for a match against the MetroStars (7-8-2, 23 points). With 11 regular-season games left, the Revolution is in danger of being one of only two teams that will miss the playoffs.\n\n''My ultimate goal is to win,'' said Twellman, who on Wednesday was named to the starting 11 for the M.L.S. All-Star Game on Aug. 3 in Washington. ''I can't take any personal glory when we're not winning, but I'm just happy I'm playing. To be honest, that's the reason I came back to the States.''\n\nTwellman left the University of Maryland after his sophomore season, having helped the Terrapins reach the N.C.A.A. semifinals as a freshman in 1998, leading the team in scoring both years.\n\n''Taylor just felt that he couldn't stay any longer,'' Sasho Cirovski, Maryland's coach, said of Twellman. ''Of course the timing was tough. I'm not a huge proponent of kids going over the Europe because most Americans are still branded as developing players.''\n\nAfter playing for the United States at the under-20 world championships in Nigeria in 1999 (winning the bronze boot as the tournament's third-leading scorer), Twellman packed up his life and moved to Germany. But he landed on 1860's reserve team, never getting a sniff with the first team.\n\n''It was a humbling experience for me,'' said Twellman. ''My first year, I led the reserves in scoring. The coach told me I might be ready by the time I was 24.''\n\nLast September, the club offered to extend his contract.\n\n''I told them I wanted to wait a week, to think it over,'' Twellman said. ''A week later, 9/11 happened. It made my decision for me.''\n\nThe young American said there was a lack of sympathy among his teammates. ''I suggested the players wear black armbands,'' he said. ''The coach said I must be nuts.''\n\nMaking himself available in the M.L.S. draft, Twellman was taken second over all by New England and is signed through the 2003 season. He has already had renewed interest from teams in Europe, including Germany.\n\nBefore the season, the Revolution appeared to be one of the most improved teams in the league. After M.L.S. dropped the Miami and Tampa Bay franchises, New England landed two former league-leading scorers -- Mamadou Diallo and Alex Pi\u00f1eda Chacon -- plus the national team defender Carlos Llamosa.\n\nBut the club stumbled early and often, which led to the dismissal of Coach Fernando Clavijo. Diallo fell out of favor, eventually being traded to the MetroStars. Pi\u00f1eda Chacon has not started since May 19. New England has also been beset by injuries. But Twellman has seized his opportunity.\n\n''Obviously, he is the rookie of the year in M.L.S.,'' said Steve Nicol, the Revolution's interim coach. ''He's a typical striker, he wants to score goals all the time. But one has to be careful not to get carried away. Half a season doesn't give you star status. You have to be consistent.''\n\nTwellman comes from an athletic family. His father, Tim, played in the North American Soccer League. His mother, Moochie, played field hockey, golf and softball. One uncle, Jay Delsing, has been on the PGA Tour and now plays on the Buy.com Tour. His grandfather, Jim Delsing, earned a footnote in baseball history as the pinch-runner for the St. Louis Browns after the midget Eddie Gaedel had drawn a walk in a 1951 game.\n\nA star shortstop in high school, Twellman turned down an offer from the Kansas City Royals, opting for a career prowling the penalty area on a soccer field.\n\n''Taylor's game follows his personality: he's a poacher,'' said MetroStars goalkeeper Tim Howard, who played with Twellman on the United States team in Nigeria. ''You're not going to see Taylor get 18 touches of the ball. But he'll get one or two, and bang, it's in the net.''\n\nWhispered criticism of Twellman's game has zeroed in on his penchant for ''only'' scoring goals -- an absurd assertion in a game that can end the same way it began.\n\n''I love to score goals,'' Twellman said. ''The box is my territory. I've always been that way. I guess it's innate.''\n\nSOCCER"

        "document": "Even though the world's greatest marathon runner cleared the last piece of government red tape to become an American citizen yesterday, there is considerable uncertainty about whether he will ever cross the tape at the finish line Oct. 1 at the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.\n\nKhalid Khannouchi, the Moroccan-born runner who is the world record-holder in the marathon, left important questions unanswered yesterday as he was naturalized in a ceremony in Houston. It is still not known whether he will compete in the Olympic trials on Sunday in Pittsburgh, only three weeks after running the London Marathon, whether he would have a realistic chance of qualifying for the Sydney Games and whether he would subject himself to further injury that could ruin his career.\n\nKhannouchi, who lives in Ossining, N.Y., is expected to announce his intentions today at a news conference in Manhattan. Some running experts doubt that he will run, and his own trainer cautioned against it after Khannouchi aggravated ankle and hamstring injuries during the London Marathon.\n\nHowever, his wife, Sandra, who is also his agent, has given conflicting statements about the seriousness of his injuries. And it could be that Khannouchi feels obligated to compete, given the cadre of people who have helped him gain his citizenship, and given nationalistic pressures to win an Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe marathoner qualified for naturalization under an immigration rule, normally used by the military, that grants citizenship to spouses of American citizens working abroad for American companies. Sandra Khannouchi recently took a job in Madrid with a San Diego-based company called Elite Racing.\n\nKhalid Khannouchi came to the United States to compete in the World University Games in 1993 and remained because he felt he was being treated unfairly by Moroccan track officials.\n\n''I'm extremely happy that my quest for U.S. citizenship has been successful,'' Khannouchi said in a statement. ''I look forward to competing in national and international championship events as an American citizen.''\n\nLater, at a news conference in a meeting room of the Houston City Council, Khannouchi declined to reveal his plans for the marathon trials, indicating he might do that today. Asked about his physical condition, he admitted to being tired, but added: ''It's not only physical. It's also mental. I been through a lot of problems, but what I want to say is it's over now. I don't want to think about what happened in the past. I don't want to think about the past. I just want to clear my mind. I want to take a long vacation and think what's the next schedule.''\n\nAside from whether Khannouchi will compete Sunday, an equally important question is whether he should compete. Most elite marathoners run no more than two marathons a year, much less two in three weeks. If Khannouchi competes in the trials and the Olympic marathon, he will have run four races of 26.2 miles in a period of 12 months, which would undoubtedly put a severe strain on his muscles, joints and connective tissue. His Ireland-based trainer, Gerard Hartmann, told NBC's Olympic Web site that ''Khalid has had injuries that could curtail his career.'' Khannouchi told reporters yesterday that he would consult with Hartmann again before making a decision.\n\n''I tell athletes you never, ever start a marathon injured,'' said David Martin, a professor of physiology at Georgia State University, who coaches marathon runners and who is chairman of sports science of USA Track and Field, the national governing body. ''At the elite level, the marathon is tragic in terms of what it can do to destroy your career, particularly with injuries related to motion. I hope whatever decision is made is good for Khalid's career as an athlete and not for who is going to profit.''\n\nIn a recent interview, Khannouchi said unequivocally that he would not run both the London Marathon and the Olympic trials. However, Sandra Khannouchi began saying before London that he might consider both. Her statements followed a talk with Harry Gee, Khannouchi's Houston-based attorney, who said he learned from a reporter that Khannouchi was running London; he expressed irritation that Khannouchi evidently did not plan to enter the Olympic trials.\n\n''We had a much more comprehensive discussion after that occasion,'' Gee said in a recent interview. ''Our purpose of being involved is to help the U.S. get a gold medal. If that wasn't his purpose, certainly we would appreciate being made aware of those circumstances.''\n\nIf Khannouchi does not enter the trials, he could still make the Olympic team at 10,000 meters at the national track and field trials in July in Sacramento. In the 10,000, he would have only an outside chance for a medal. In the marathon, a healthy Khannouchi would be favored to win America's first gold medal since Frank Shorter's victory at the 1972 Munich Olympics. And though he is a Moroccan native, a victory would nevertheless be a boost to a bleak American distance-running program. He set the world record of 2 hours 5 minutes 42 seconds last October at the Chicago Marathon. His personal best is four minutes faster than the next American.\n\nTrack and field's international governing body has said that Khannouchi would not need permission from Morocco to compete for the United States in Sydney. Even if he did need permission, Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, would probably intervene with the Moroccan federation, given his stated determination to have the world's best athletes compete in the Olympics. A healthy Khannouchi could essentially match the other Americans with a ''jog in the park'' at the trials, Martin said, but an injured Khannouchi ''comes back to the other runners' level of fitness.''\n\nHow hurt is Khannouchi? His wife has given contradictory statements in recent days, telling reporters that her husband's injuries were both potentially career threatening and relatively minor.\n\n''I think he's probably going to run, but I think he's going to have his work cut out to finish in the top three,'' said Mark Coogan, a 1996 Olympian and one of the favorites on Sunday. ''We may not run 2:08, but we're not bums.''\n\nKhannouchi, David Morris and Joe LeMay are the only three Americans who have achieved the Olympic ''A'' qualifying standard of 2:14. But even if Khannouchi runs, there may not be a large margin for error in making the team. Complicating matters are a hilly course in Pittsburgh and temperatures that could reach the high 70's or 80.\n\nHe could best control his destiny by winning or finishing in the top three. However, even a top-three finish may not guarantee an Olympic berth under the complicated formula that determines qualifiers. If the winner runs slower than 2:14 and is someone other than Khannouchi, Morris and LeMay, only the winner would qualify for Sydney. There are other possibilities in which Khannouchi could finish in the middle of the pack, or even last, and still qualify for the Olympics because he has already met the A standard.\n\n''I'm glad for the guy; I think he's doing it for the right reasons,'' Coogan said of Khannouchi's citizenship. ''It will be interesting to see how well he does if he runs. If he kills everyone, he might as well wear a cape and an 'S' on his chest.''\n\nOLYMPICS"

        "document": "Time cannot erase the criminal responsibility of Pol Pot, whose murderous rule of Cambodia in the late 1970's brought death to about a million people, or one out of seven Cambodians. Trying him before an international tribunal would advance justice, promote healing in Cambodia and give pause to any fanatic tempted to follow his example.\n\nPlans to deliver Pol Pot to international custody have been rumored before. But this time the possibility seems more realistic, thanks to President Clinton's intervention. In an unusual but well-justified use of American assistance, Mr. Clinton has ordered the Departments of Defense, State and Justice to help plan for the arrest and trial of Pol Pot. The American Government will help move the 73-year-old former Cambodian leader to a country where he can be tried once he is arrested and will prepare the legal groundwork for prosecuting him.\n\nSince last year, Pol Pot has been held prisoner by a faction of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla movement he once headed. The weakened guerrillas are based near the Thai-Cambodian border and are willing to discuss turning him over to an international tribunal. Alternatively, the Thai Army could easily seize Pol Pot, and apparently will do so if Washington promises to whisk him out of Thailand.\n\nPol Pot's eventual destination should be the Netherlands, where the United Nations Security Council could set up an international tribunal to try him, similar to the tribunal now trying war crimes suspects from Bosnia. The Security Council should certainly do that. One hitch might be a veto by China, which has protected Pol Pot in the past. China's leaders, seeking a wider role in world affairs, should recognize that further efforts to shield Pol Pot would damage their standing.\n\nThe uncertainty about China's intentions in this case underscores the need for a permanent and effective International Criminal Court to try future cases of crimes against humanity. Such a court has been held up by Washington's misplaced fear that a tribunal would unjustly try American soldiers accused of criminal conduct abroad. But the business of an international criminal court would be to try people like Pol Pot, who are charged with the most egregious crimes, and only when their own nations  cannot or will not. For now, Bangkok, Washington and the Security Council should do what is necessary to hold Pol Pot accountable for his monstrous crimes."

American teachers at the school, as well as 60 children of other nationalities, were also safe, said James Forlines, director of Free Will Baptist Foreign Missions in Nashville.\n\n''It was just a little before 11 a.m. that the French troops arrived in force and they were evacuated a few hours later,'' said Mr. Forlines, whose organization has missionaries at the school. ''They were very much relieved.''\n\nOn Tuesday, at the request of the American ambassador in Ivory Coast, the United States dispatched about 200 troops, mostly Special Forces, from Germany. The deployment followed a night and day of heaving gunfire and shelling in Bouak\u00e9, which has been held by rebel forces since last Thursday.\n\nFrance had already sent hundreds of its own troops to help evacuate foreigners living in Bouak\u00e9, including 600 of its own citizens. The rebels also control another major city, Korhogo, in the north.\n\nLast Thursday, soldiers staged uprisings in Abidjan, the commercial capital, and in Bouak\u00e9 and Korhogo. Loyalist forces quickly put down the uprising in Abidjan, but have struggled to oust the rebels in the other cities.\n\nIvory Coast, which many foreign organizations use as a base for their operations in West Africa, has suffered from chronic instability since its first military coup in late 1999. In a country that was once a model for ethnic and religious harmony, the recent events have dangerously deepened the country's many internal divisions.\n\nThrough its news media, the government, led by Christian southerners, has accused Muslim northerners of being behind the failed coup attempt. It accused the northerners of being allied with the president of neighboring Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaor\u00e9. Mr. Compaor\u00e9's government rejected the accusations.\n\nToday, the Ivoirian government said it was severing telephone links to Burkina Faso, and youths attacked the Burkina Faso Embassy in Abidjan, damaging its gates."

        "document": "A patient Andre Agassi let the whirling Andrew Ilie burn through his bag of Harlem Globetrotter shots today and use up the energy that the crowd kept heaping on the frenetic Aussie.\n\nWhile Agassi survived his Round of 16 match, second-seeded Marat Safin was upset by 14th-seeded Dominik Hrbaty, 6-2, 7-6 (6), 6-4.\n\nAgassi was not sure, but he was hoping the unseeded Ilie would come back to earth inside Rod Laver Arena. Just after he stunned everyone by taking the first set against sixth-seeded Agassi in the Australian Open's Round of 16, Ilie came up with one of his tricks at the start of the second set.\n\nIn the third game, Ilie raced to a ball behind the baseline, flicked a running lob off his back foot and watched it land just over Agassi's head for game point. With the flair of a Chippendale dancer, Ilie gyrated his hips, pumped his fists and caused a roar from the pack of Ilie fanatics.\n\nBut Ilie's roundhouse swings began to miss, and his flying returns started to go awry. Eventually, the even-keeled Agassi advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-7 (1), 6-3, 6-0, 6-3 victory over the Romanian-born Australian resident. During one stretch in the second and third sets, Agassi won 10 straight games.\n\n''I have to say it's much more enjoyable watching him than playing against him,'' Agassi said. ''He really hits some shots you can't believe a person would attempt, let alone make. It's great for the game. It's hard to play against.''\n\nOnce Agassi broke Ilie's serve in the eighth game of the second set, he could see the color slip out of his opponent's game.\n\n''Up until that point, he made me a believer,'' Agassi said. ''Fortunately, the tide turned. It looked like he was more out of position on a lot of the shots he was going for, and I was getting the errors, got the lead and kind of stayed on top of him.''\n\nDavis Cup Surprise?\n\nChris Woodruff was not the anticipated messenger to deliver Davis Cup news Saturday afternoon, but along with mentioning himself as one the Americans who will play against Switzerland in February, he said 41-year-old John McEnroe may play.\n\n''It's more than a gut feeling, but I'm not going to say because I really don't know,'' Woodruff said.\n\nPatrick McEnroe, who took over the Davis Cup team after his brother, John, resigned in December, was not available for comment. The team was not expected to be named until next week. But a few moments after Yevgeny Kafelnikov ended Woodruff's Australian Open run in the third round, 6-7 (3), 7-5, 6-2, 6-3, Woodruff said he would be joined on the team by Jan-Michael Gambill, Todd Martin and a fourth, possibly John McEnroe.\n\nIt is an intriguing situation for a team that has produced little interest. Woodruff seemed to welcome the idea of Patrick McEnroe selecting his older brother to be his teammate.\n\n''Just as long as those two don't clash and tussle over who is captain, it'll be O.K.,'' Woodruff said. ''We have a good team.''\n\nDementieva Loses Audience\n\nElena Dementieva found out just how lonely losing at the top can be. After she was upset Saturday night by 17-year-old Daja Bedanova, 2-6, 7-6 (5), 6-3, in a third-round match, Dementieva, 19 and the ninth-seeded player, was told she must go into the interview room or be fined. When she finally arrived late, the match between Lleyton Hewitt and Carlos Moya had already begun. No one was there to talk to Dementieva. She left without saying a word.\n\nIt was Bedanova's night. She was the focus of everyone's attention. She showed uncommon poise for a young player who entered this major tournament ranked 54th. By mixing a net game with her ground strokes, she fought back from 4-2 down in the second-set tie breaker and hit two aces to close out the match.\n\n''It's easier to finish the point like this,'' Bedanova said with a giggle.\n\nBedanova was born in the Czech Republic and lived in Germany for several years before moving to the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Florida almost two years ago. In every location, her father has coached her.\n\nTaking Sides on Prize Money\n\nYevgeny Kafelnikov has found himself in the center of a feud that will not die. After Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi and Todd Martin ridiculed Kafelnikov for his complaints concerning tennis prize money as it related to what golfers were making, Kafelnikov snapped back.\n\n''I'm a stand-up guy and I'm going to say what I want to say,'' Kafelnikov said Saturday. ''I don't really care what the American democratic opinion is. If you look at the releases in the press, the only guys who make statements were American.''\n\nTENNIS: NOTEBOOK"

        "document": "Why do they hate us? According to a theory being tested this year by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, an arm of the United States government, they hate us because we haven't been playing them enough J. Lo. In March, the B.B.G. addressed that shortfall by budgeting $35 million to start Radio Sawa, a 24-hour radio network broadcasting from studios in Washington to FM stations in Jordan, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar; it's also piped into Iraq, past Saddam's scramblers, via Kuwait.\n\nRadio Sawa is the brainchild of Norman Pattiz, chairman of the Westwood One radio network. Soon after President Clinton appointed him to help oversee the government's foreign broadcasting efforts, Pattiz took a fact-finding trip to the Middle East, and he came back with two observations: there is a ''media war'' going on in the Arab world, and the United States is losing.\n\nThe Arab-language all-talk Voice of America, also under the control of the B.B.G., wasn't up to the fight, Pattiz concluded. It was boring, especially to the younger generation Pattiz wanted to target. Radio Sawa, by contrast, is lots of fun: an upbeat mix of contemporary Western and Arabic pop (J. Lo segues quite nicely into the Egyptian heartthrob Hisham Abbas, it turns out), no ads and two brief news segments each hour, presenting the events of the day with a gently pro-American spin. Pattiz recruited Arab journalists from Al Hayat (a London-based newspaper) and ''Nightline'' to write the news briefs.\n\nOfficially, the reports are balanced and objective, seeking the truth from all sides. But critics charge that Radio Sawa presents the American point of view more explicitly than Voice of America did. For example, the V.O.A. was criticized in Washington late in 2001 for broadcasting excerpts from an interview with the Taliban leader Mullah Muhammed Omar; the news director of Radio Sawa, by contrast, told reporters that he wouldn't have broadcast Omar's interview, nor would he broadcast the voice of Saddam Hussein. President Bush's June 24, 2002, speech calling on Palestinians to replace Yasir Arafat, however, was broadcast live in its entirety, translated instantly into Arabic.\n\nThe message comes through in the music, too -- like Casey Kasem, the D.J.'s on Radio Sawa introduce each song with a story about the artist. ''When we play a song by Jennifer Lopez, we talk about all the difficulties she has overcome,'' Pattiz explains. ''Those are great stories about the kind of things that can happen to you when you live in a democracy.''\n\nThough reliable ratings figures are sometimes difficult to come by, so far indications are that Radio Sawa (sawa means ''together'' in Arabic) is getting through: Pattiz says that 80 percent of 18- to 30-year-olds in Amman are regular listeners. And the network is expanding; this month, the B.B.G. plans to start a Radio Sawa-like service that will broadcast in Farsi to Iran.\n\nThe main problem, so far, is that the network's young Arab listeners seem to like the pop a lot more than they like the news: Avril Lavigne, yes; Condoleezza Rice, no. One Jordanian listener told the BBC that he listens to the music on Radio Sawa all the time but turns the dial whenever the news comes on. ''It's like listening to Israeli radio,'' he said. ''It's biased.''\n\nPaul Tough"

        "document": "Like many teen-agers in Bosnia, Faruk Sabanovic took up skiing after watching the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. But years of civil war left Sarajevo's ski resorts in shambles, and a sniper's bullet left Mr. Sabanovic a paraplegic.\n\n''I was a good skier,'' the 21-year-old Bosnian recalled recently from his wheelchair here, as legions of young Americans romped in the fresh snow and bright sunshine of this Rocky Mountain resort. ''The snow looks great. I can't wait to start again.''\n\nMr. Sabanovic and eight other disabled Bosnians had a free week of skiing here, paid for by the ski area, Disabled Sports U.S.A. and the International Rescue Committee.\n\nA year ago, on Dec. 14, President Clinton signed the Dayton peace accords and sent American peacekeeping troops to Bosnia. In a less publicized sequel, people across the United States have opened their homes and their wallets over the last year to Bosnia's war victims.\n\nNext year, in a sign of the times, the number of Bosnian refugees scheduled to be settled in the United States is to surpass the number of Vietnamese refugees expected to settle in the country. While the number of Vietnamese arriving here fell to 17,000 in 1996, the number of Bosnians is to rise to 18,000 next year, 10 times the level of 1993.\n\nBy the end of 1997, about 1 percent of Bosnia's prewar population of 4.6 million will be living in the United States, where communities from Oxford, Pa., to Durango, Colo., have pooled resources to help the refugees.\n\nIn Durango, 11 families were hosts to Muslim high school students from Sarajevo. In Oxford, all proceeds from ticket sales for a historic house tour went to Bosnia programs maintained by World Vision, a Christian relief and development organization in Washington.\n\n''The money raised for Bosnia is not blowing the doors off like it did during the Ethiopian famine, but it is having an impact,'' said Kathleen Brown, a spokeswoman for World Vision. ''We want to bring attention to what the humanitarian troops are doing. Our aid is not wrapped around the U.S. military presence.''\n\nIn the former Yugoslavia, United States troops and aid workers are largely concentrated in Bosnia, the breakaway nation most ravaged by Yugoslavia's four-year civil war. Since 1991, the United States Government has sent about $1.6 billion on relief and reconstruction aid to Bosnia. Over the last year, private American aid groups have spent $40 million in that country.\n\n''Maybe the shooting has stopped, but we want to bring the attention of Americans and of corporate America to the 25,000 Bosnians who are disabled,'' said Neil A. Lichter, spokesman for Disabled Sports U.S.A., a group in Rockville, Md., that helps athletes.\n\nIn Sarajevo, only two public buildings -- the main hospital and the main post office -- have wheelchair ramps. Mr. Sabanovic, a former physics student, is unable to resume his studies at the university in Bosnia because curbs and stairs block his access.\n\nMary Lou Hunt, a physical therapist from Texas who is with the International Rescue Committee, says that when she first went to Bosnia, in 1994, she met disabled children and adults who had not got out of bed for a year because they did not have wheelchairs.\n\nOver the last year, in Bosnia, the committee has distributed wheelchairs donated by several private groups, including Quickie Wheelchairs of San Francisco and the National Wheelchair Basketball Association.\n\nMr. Sabanovic, the founder of a Bosnian handicapped-rights group, the Center for Self Reliance, came to Breckenridge not only to learn how to ski again, but to network with the 500 disabled American skiers who had gathered here for the Ski Spectacular, an annual event sponsored by the I.T.T. Hartford Group.\n\nBosnia's national ski team -- four members and a coach -- completed a free 18-day stay at Breckenridge. American Airlines flew the team, along with their 32 pairs of skis, to Denver from their training camp in northern Italy. Resort Express, a van service, brought the group here from the airport. The Village at Breckenridge provided free meals and hotel rooms. The Breckenridge Ski Resort waived lift tickets and fees to compete in Alpine World Cup races here.\n\n''They called us up from Italy, and said they wanted to come, but didn't have the resources,'' recalled Gary Dutmers, the ski area's spokesman. ''We felt it would be a good act in the spirit of international good will. It is the first time they have ever competed outside of Europe.''\n\nThe visit of the Bosnians has not been made without a few cultural clashes. Unfazed by treacherous driving in snowbound mountains, the Bosnians are rattled by the no-smoking signs they find at every turn.\n\nA car carrying two disabled Bosnians was traveling down a mountain road south of here when it skidded down a 20-foot embankment, colliding with two other cars that had also slid off the road.\n\nKadira Nukic, an amputee who lost most of her family in the war, turned to her American driver and asked, ''Do you suppose it would be all right if I smoked now?''"

        "document": "With  battle ensign flying, crew on deck saluting and cheering and sound system booming songs ranging from ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' to an irreverent hit by the Detroit rapper Kid Rock, the patched-up destroyer Cole limped away from Aden harbor today with a show of unbowed pride as it cleared the moorings where 17 sailors were killed in a suicide bombing attack.\n\nAlmost 17 days after the guided missile destroyer entered Aden for a refueling stop that turned into one of the most violent and humiliating moments in the Navy's peacetime history, the Cole was hitched to four yellow-nosed Yemeni tugs and moved out of the Gulf of Aden, where the harbor tugs handed it over to a deep-sea Navy tug, the Catawba.\n\nAt first light on Monday, about 25 miles out, the Navy will begin the 36-hour task, itself risky and unprecedented, of raising the 8,600-ton ship onto the deck of a chartered Norwegian salvage ship for the five-week, 6,000-mile voyage home.\n\nThe Cole's defiant exit came with the scars of the ordeal still visible in the jagged, 40-by-40-foot blast hole at the waterline and whole sections of the gunmetal-gray superstructure still rent and twisted from the attack made on Oct. 12 by two suicide bombers in an explosives-laden skiff. But the Navy, which says it intends to return the ship to service despite the costly task of rebuilding a mangled engine room and messhalls, as well as possible keel damage that will only be fully assessed in an American drydock, sent out an unmistakable message with the perky way in which it sent one of its most sophisticated warships out of the harbor.\n\n''What happened on Oct. 12 was a tragedy, it was an insult, but I think what was clear this morning as we watched the U.S.S. Cole is that it was not in any way a defeat,'' said Barbara K. Bodine, the American ambassador. Ms. Bodine has played a leading role in the large American task force sent to Aden to help in the struggle to keep the Cole from sinking, open a criminal investigation and devise ways of getting the crippled ship home.\n\nShe added: ''The Cole left proudly.  She left with some help from her friends, but she left proudly.''\n\nThe defiance was mixed with a bleak admission that it may be weeks, months or even longer before investigators can fulfill President Clinton's vow to track down those responsible for the attack. A week ago, after Yemeni security police officials found a string of safe houses used by the bombers, as well as an abandoned sport utility vehicle and a trailer used to launch the boat that carried the bomb, American officials said that a ''quantum leap'' had been made in the investigation. The advance reinforced the F.B.I.'s ''working theory'' that the attackers belonged to the same broad network of Afghan-trained Arabs who drove Soviet forces from Afghanistan, and  then turned in the 1990's to a ''holy war'' against the United States.\n\nBut Ms. Bodine acknowledged today that no conclusive progress toward identifying the culprits had been made, and that the task ahead for the investigation ''will not be short, and it will not be easy.'' She implied that the investigation had gotten bogged down in trying to move beyond the initial breakthroughs, a problem American officials have said has been accentuated by a Yemeni security police embargo that has severely curtailed the F.B.I.'s role in the case. ''We do not have any suspects, and we do not know at this time who is behind this,'' Ms. Bodine said. ''I don't think anyone knows how long this will take.''\n\nThe Cole's departure came after Navy frogmen, metal cutters, and welders and other specialists had worked around the clock for more than two weeks to get the ship seaworthy enough for a safe rendezvous with the salvage ship, the Blue Marlin, which the Navy has hired at a cost of $4.5 million to piggyback the destroyer. The salvage vessel, usually used for hoisting massive oil-drilling rigs in and out of the Persian Gulf and the North Sea, will employ an innovative technology in which it pumps water into its ballast tanks, slides under the Cole, then raises itself and the Navy ship by pumping the ballast water out again.\n\nNavy officials have acknowledged that lifting the Cole, which has to be done in waters 70 feet deep or more, is not foolproof, and that the risks are compounded by lingering uncertainties left after Navy divers inspected the Cole's hull and keel. But even those worries paled when set beside the tasks that had to be completed before the Navy could think about towing the Cole away.\n\nFirst, divers, metal cutters, welders and others had to recover the 17 sailors' bodies, a task that took nine days to complete. Then they had to weld new plates into the punctured hull and bulkheads, and pump out millions of gallons of seawater that had flooded the lower decks. Even late on Saturday, the welders could still be seen at work near the blast hole, sparks flying. A Navy spokesman said the repairs had left the ship ''structurally sound,'' but acknowledged that after the work here, the Cole was ''patched'' and ''cauterized'' -- in effect, a pale relic of the high-technology, cruise-missile-firing, billion-dollar ship it was.\n\nLong-term wounds to the Navy's pride may still lie ahead as admirals, senators and others, at inquiries already begun in Washington, investigate the reasons for the Pentagon's sending warships to refuel in a country called a ''safe haven for terrorists'' and then issuing orders that placed the ships at the second-lowest level of alert in the Navy's handbook. But today, at least, Cmdr. Karl S. Lippold, the Cole's captain, made sure that 200 crewmen still aboard held their heads high. As the ship cast off, the crew lined up at bow and stern to salute a giant Stars and Stripes fluttering stiffly from the mast, raised from half-mast after the mourning period for the sailors who were killed.\n\nOther red-and-yellow pennants, marking out a stay-clear warning used by mariners for centuries, signaled that the vessel was ''maneuvering with difficulty,'' under tow. Above, Navy attack helicopters prowled like hornets, and at least four picket boats with armed marines -- a precaution absent when the Cole arrived -- patrolled back and forth. But with thousands of Yemenis lining the harbor, and the crew of a rusting, Russian-built Yemeni navy patrol boat saluting, the main message was one of pride.\n\nAlong with ''The Star-Spangled Banner,'' the recorded tunes blasted from the destroyer's loudspeakers included ''America the Beautiful,''  ''Anchors Aweigh,'' the Marine Hymn, and, by what the Navy said was the choice of the Cole's enlisted men, a rap identified by many American reporters as ''American Bad Ass'' by Kid Rock.\n\nMs. Bodine, the American ambassador, described the choice of the rap song as a case of the crew's ''making a joyful noise.'' But heard from a shoreline sailors' club, it seemed encoded with defiance for violent Islamic groups, and an in-your-face exuberance at leaving Yemen.\n\nMs. Bodine, the task force's sole spokesman for much of the last two weeks, acknowledged that little progress had been made in American attempts to reverse a Yemeni security police embargo that has sharply curtailed the F.B.I.'s role.\n\n''We are still -- negotiating is the wrong word -- we are still working with the Yemenis very closely on the modalities of how you do this,'' Ms. Bodine said. She said the United States remained confident that President Ali Abdullah Saleh would keep his commitment ''to seeing this through to the end.''"

        "document": "Last week, the White House summoned James Baker III, the Bush family's persuader of last resort, back to public service. His new portfolio is the diplomatically ticklish and economically crucial problem of restructuring Iraq's currently unpayable official debts. As a former secretary of both the State and Treasury Departments and a public and private Middle East deal maker, he is in many ways a supremely qualified choice. Yet as it stands right now, Mr. Baker is far too tangled in a matrix of lucrative private business relationships that leave him looking like a potentially interested party in any debt-restructuring formula. The obvious solution is for him to sever his ties to all firms doing work directly or indirectly related to Iraq.\n\nMr. Baker is senior counselor to the Carlyle Group, a global investment company that has done business with the Saudi royal family. He is also a partner in Baker Botts, a Houston law firm whose client list includes Halliburton. Baker Botts has an office in Riyadh and a strategic alliance with another firm in the United Arab Emirates, and it deploys Mr. Baker's name and past government service on its Web site to solicit Middle East business. It is inappropriate for Mr. Baker to remain attached to these businesses, whose clients and potential future clients could be affected by the decisions made about Iraq's official debt.\n\nIraq's overall debt is estimated at something over $100 billion, with another $100 billion or so owed in reparations. Just servicing that debt, without paying back any principal, looks beyond the means of a country whose oil revenues amounted to only $13 billion in the last full year before the war.\n\nFinding a way to persuade creditor nations like France, Russia and the Persian Gulf Arab states to forgive part of Iraq's debt and restructure the rest is critical to the administration's foreign policy. It is no wonder the president turned to an experienced hand like Mr. Baker, whose legal maneuvering in Florida did so much to secure his hold on the White House in 2000. Yet before any of this can happen, Mr. Baker must show that he will be free of any private business entanglements that could raise legitimate questions about his recommendations. If the administration needs a political reason for doing the right thing, it need only look at the deep suspicion raised about the Iraqi construction contracts doled out to Halliburton, a company that was run by Dick Cheney before he became vice president.\n\nMr. Baker has agreed to forgo earnings from clients with obvious connections to Iraqi debts, a process that Baker Botts attorneys would supervise for the law firm and that the White House would oversee for the Carlyle Group. That is not good enough. Businesses like Carlyle and Baker Botts make their living by flaunting their connections to the politically powerful. To perform honorably in his new public job, Mr. Baker must give up these two private ones."

        "document": "For decades, human rights groups have spoken out against deplorable conditions inside Peru's penitentiary system, where many inmates live in cold, overcrowded cells that have no running water or toilets except for a hole in the floor.\n\nNow those notoriously harsh prison conditions have emerged as a likely bargaining point in negotiations to free the remaining 83 hostages held by Marxist guerrillas at the Japanese Ambassador's residence in Lima.\n\nThe Tupac Amaru rebels, who initially demanded freedom for all their jailed comrades, have indicated that  they may be willing to settle for the release of some compatriots and better prison conditions for others.\n\nIn their latest statement after the release of 20 hostages on Saturday, the guerrillas listed only one demand: improved conditions for incarcerated rebels, who are generally treated much worse than other prisoners because they have been convicted or accused of terrorism.\n\nSo far, the Government has not publicly offered the guerrillas any concessions, except safe passage if they let all hostages go free.\n\nBut foreign diplomats and human rights groups who are monitoring the negotiations said they believe that better prison conditions is a compromise that President Alberto K. Fujimori could live with, especially since the Government has been moving toward such improvements.\n\n''Prison conditions are an easy thing to negotiate because Fujimori was already considering them and they can be justified on humanitarian grounds,'' said an ambassador from a NATO-member country, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nSusana Villaran, executive secretary of the National Coordination of Human Rights, a nongovernmental agency, said, ''It's very important that convicted terrorists serve time for the crimes they have committed, but these horrible and Draconian conditions have to be changed.''\n\nMs. Villaran said that while she did not condone the taking of the Japanese residence, ''there is a great opportunity here to set hostages free and improve the health of the whole prison population.''\n\nBut the foreign diplomats said they expect the rebels to continue to seek the freedom of some colleagues, especially jailed guerrilla leaders, and other demands like a large ransom.\n\nWhen M-19 guerrillas in Colombia seized the Dominican Republic Embassy in 1980, they released their hostages in exchange for safe passage to Cuba, a large ransom, and better living conditions for their imprisoned comrades.\n\nWhile conditions inside Peruvian prisons are generally unsatisfactory, they are often unbearable for inmates who have been accused or convicted of terrorism.\n\nThose inmates are often housed in special prisons for terrorists where food is scarce and often inedible and clothing and blankets are not provided. Prisoners are given only a gallon of water a day to drink, wash, and flush the hole in the floor that serves as a toilet.\n\nIn addition to cramped cells, prisoners convicted of terrorism are not allowed outside visitors for the first year of their sentence. After that, they are granted a 30-minute visit by relatives every month. Mothers, including women who give birth while in prison, may see their children once every three months and only through a glass partition.\n\nPrisoners are allowed only 30 minutes of yard time a day, and many inmates suffer from tuberculosis, AIDS, cancer and other ailments for which they receive inadequate medical treatment.\n\nLori Helene Berenson, a New York woman who was convicted of treason for her association with the Tupac Amaru rebels last year, is serving a life sentence in Peru's most notorious prison, Yanamayo, located 12,700 feet high in the Andean town of Puno.\n\nAfter visiting their daughter earlier this month, Mark and Rhoda Berenson of Manhattan said that because of the altitude and cold, Ms. Berenson suffers from dizzy spells and circulation problems that result in swollen, purple, cut fingers. She cannot digest certain foods, mainly legumes, the main source of protein in the prison, and she has chronic sore throat and laryngitis, they said.\n\nA report released by the United States State Department last year found that hundreds of women detained in prisons and military installations for terrorism had been raped in recent years.\n\nAccording to the report, a pregnant 15-year-old girl, who had unwittingly married a Tupac Amaru rebel, was infected with AIDS in 1983 by a member of the security forces when she was detained in La Merced.\n\nDespite antiterrorism legislation that required that an adolescent be transferred to a juvenile detention site, the girl was held as an adult terrorist until her release later that year, the report said. She was not treated for AIDS, and those responsible for her rape were never punished.\n\nThe Peruvian prison system has a population of 22,210 inmates, more than half of which have only been charged with crimes and are awaiting trial. Although exact figures are not available, human rights groups estimate that between 4,000 and 5,000 prisoners have been convicted or accused of terrorism.\n\nVictor Polay, the founder of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, who was captured in 1993, is being held at a maximum security prison at a naval base just outside Lima, where he has remained in solitary confinement. Mr. Polay is said to be in poor physical and mental health and to pass his days talking to himself.\n\nAfter many years of harsh conditions inside terrorist prisons, many inmates try to commit suicide by repeatedly throwing themselves against iron bars and concrete floors. Those inmates are typically kept heavily sedated."

Responding to bloody clashes between crowds of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez's supporters and foes, military leaders last week removed Mr. Ch\u00e1vez from office, declared that he had resigned and sought to install a businessman as president. Additional protests and internal struggles were the undoing of the takeover, and Mr. Ch\u00e1vez returned to office on Sunday.\n\nDiplomats from around the hemisphere met here tonight to consider what action should be taken by the Organization of American States. The 34-nation forum last week had condemned the ouster of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez and the ''deplorable acts of violence'' that took place.\n\nC\u00e9sar Gaviria, the O.A.S. secretary general, who had just returned from a fact-finding trip to Venezuela, said he saw ''excessive polarization'' throughout society and a ''dangerous'' propensity to involve the armed forces in political affairs.\n\nMr. Gaviria also criticized acts of intimidation by Bolivarian circles, grass-roots groups loyal to Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, and threats to press freedom. Mr. Gaviria said a national dialogue is needed to avert further unrest.\n\n''There seems to be a widespread conviction that renewed confrontation between friends and opponents of the government is inevitable and could lead to increased social protest,'' Mr. Gaviria said.\n\nVenezuela's foreign minister, Luis Alfonso Davila, defended the Ch\u00e1vez government, which has tried, he said, to give voice to the poorer sectors that have been locked out of the political process.\n\nMr. Davila denied that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez had trampled the rights of his critics, and asserted that ''the true polarization'' in his country was caused by poverty and not by Mr. Ch\u00e1vez's leftist policies.\n\n''Over three years, this government might have made some mistakes,'' he said. ''But never can it be said that the Venezuelan government violated human rights. There is nobody who is persecuted or detained.''\n\nThe foreign minister offered thanks to several O.A.S. members for supporting Venezuelan democracy during the takeover. He pointedly did not mention the United States, which had blamed Mr. Ch\u00e1vez for his own undoing and established contact with his would-be successor.\n\nAt the meeting, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell pressed the Venezuelan government to protect the rights of all citizens, but directed most of his criticism toward those who sought to oust Mr. Ch\u00e1vez. ''Coups are a thing of the past, not a pathway to the future,'' he said. ''Defending democracy by undemocratic means destroys democracy.''\n\nSecretary Powell urged the O.A.S. to help broker a national dialogue in Venezuela, which officials said might be conducted with the involvement of the Episcopal Conference of the Catholic Church."

        "document": "Svetlana Ivanovna, a 57-year-old pensioner with a mind made up like a marine's bed, has a word for the liberal journalists who worked at Russia's independent television network NTV until its takeover this month: ''barbarians.''\n\nTwo words, actually. The other is ''dishonest.''\n\n''I can't say anything good about them,'' she added, for clarity's sake.\n\nBut this does not mean that she did not watch NTV during their tenure. In fact, she watched its news, and she watched its trademark Sunday newsmagazine ''Itogi'' -- the one whose bespectacled host, Yevgeny Kiselyov, she called dishonorable and haughty.\n\n''I always watched NTV; I watched it to compare,'' she said as she waited for a trolley in central Moscow one afternoon this week. ''The other channels work well.''\n\nThere lies a point lost in the hoopla over NTV, the slick and nearly bankrupt network whose takeover has loosed an international outcry over press freedom: NTV or not, Russians do, in fact, have some choices to compare.\n\nThey are already comparing the new NTV with the nation's two state-run networks, ORT and RTR, as well as with the old NTV, now on another channel. Should none of them satisfy, many can watch a cacophony of local television news programs or sample an array of competing newspapers.\n\n''It is a map of many colors,'' says Grigory Libergal, the program director for Internews, an American-backed organization that distributes cultural and educational television programs to Russian stations.\n\nIt is certainly not press freedom as Westerners know it. By virtue of its control of two networks and nationwide radio, the Kremlin has by far the biggest voice in Russian media. Local governors control another chunk. Still more is run by tycoons and industrial giants whose main goal is to promote their own interests.\n\nIn vast swaths of rural Russia, the only voice at all is a single government television channel or radio station. Eight in 10 printing presses are government-owned, and local politicians have few qualms about denying access to critics.\n\nBut neither is this the muzzled, monotone press that Russians endured and mocked when they were part of the Soviet Union. With exceptions, newspapers and broadcasters have clear biases, and show them even when they offend the powerful.\n\nJournalists operate with few of the restraints that libel and privacy laws impose on Westerners, and some of their more sensational charges would never appear in an American or British publication.\n\nState-employed journalists are generally more respectful of government power than are many independent ones -- but not always. ''Although it's still state broadcasting, it's definitely different from what it used to be,'' said Andrei Richter, who directs the Center for Media and the Law at Moscow State University. ''In the first Chechen war, for example, the most critical coverage was not from NTV, but from Russian broadcasting, RTR.''\n\nHe was referring to Russia's first assault against separatist rebels in Chechnya, in 1995, during which RTR gained a reputation for refusing to toe the Kremlin line. RTR is not alone: journalists from the second state-dominated network, ORT, were noted in 1998 for their tough coverage of events in Belarus, a close Russia ally.\n\nAnd in the face of what many outsiders call a government campaign to crush NTV's former owner, the media tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky, journalists here can and do produce scorching reports about abuses of government power.\n\nThe most recent example involves Anna Politkovskaya, a correspondent for the Moscow daily Novaya Gazeta, who endured official arrest and harrowing threats to produce a damning report about the detention and ransom of innocent Chechen men by the Russian military.\n\nMs. Politkovskaya's report, which Russian officials contend is groundless, recently earned the Overseas Press Club's first annual award for exceptional courage in reporting on Russia.\n\nHow many people actually see such reporting is a different issue. For starters, huge numbers of Russians outside media centers like Moscow and St. Petersburg are too consumed by the rigors of daily life to follow politics and current affairs.\n\nAlthough the war over control of NTV consumed much of Moscow for weeks, national opinion polls suggests that the average Russian's response was more muted.\n\nIn a poll of 1,500 Russians taken on April 7 by the Public Opinion Foundation, a respected Moscow survey organization, 40 percent saw the takeover of NTV by the state-dominated monpoly Gazprom as a negative event. Forty-three percent either applauded the takeover or were indifferent.\n\n''I think a great number of Russians, more than 80 percent, feel they don't need any kind of information -- either political or economic,'' said Oleg Panfilov, who directs Moscow's Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations. ''In many regions of Russia, people don't even buy newspapers because they think they're expensive.''\n\nMs. Politkovskaya's reporting produced a brief sensation in the Russian media. But Russia is so huge -- and so poor -- that the print press is in steep decline here. There is little advertising, and distribution has become so expensive that virtually all newspapers of any size rely on rich patrons -- tycoons or companies -- to survive.\n\nNewspaper circulation has dropped precipitously in the last decade. Those few that prosper shun serious news for celebrity gossip and other light fare.\n\nThat leaves television as the main source of information for most Russians, and state-run television as the major national provider of news. The state channels, ORT and RTR, together span almost all of Russia; NTV, their quasi-private competitor, covers much of the nation, but often via a grainy and weaker UHF signal.\n\nAccording to Internews, the ratings war among the three networks has been fierce. In the week ending March 25, just before NTV's management succumbed to a boardroom coup, the ORT evening news program Vremya claimed a 29.2 percent share of the audience, while NTV's Sevodnya garnered 16.4 percent and RTR's Vesti 13.2 percent.\n\n''But if you're living in, say, Krasnoyarsk'' -- a large city in southern Siberia -- ''those three programs would compete for viewers with local news on Channel 9 and TVK Channel 6,'' as well as three or four others, Mr. Richter said.\n\nThere are as many as 700 local television stations in Russia. ''For my money,'' he said, ''they're better than the central channels. They're more objective, less biased, and they try harder to show all sides of an issue.''\n\nOne of the best -- TV2 in Tomsk, a university city in south-central Russia -- dominates local television ratings, in part because of its aggressive news coverage. The station employs about 30 on its news staff and boasts that it was the only local broadcaster with on-the-scene coverage of the 1991 coup attempt that led to the disintegration of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe station competes against a channel subsidized by the regional government and two other smaller stations. TV2 is lucky, said Viktoriya S. Muchnik, the news programs producer: advertising revenues alone keep it going, so political and business pressures are at a minimum.\n\n''We're dependent neither on regional nor city authorities, nor on the major financial structures,'' she said in an interview. ''Our founders are several individuals who are exclusively in the television business.''\n\nBut the station briefly went black during this month's debate over control of NTV -- a protest, she said, against what journalists saw as the potential for an even greater state control over mass communications.\n\n''We tend to think the situation with NTV is the first warning for all the mass media,'' she said. ''And since things get to the regions gradually, we think that sooner or later, the pressures from the authorities will reach here as well.''"

        "document": "Before the embassy bombings trial, Osama bin Laden loomed large in the American psyche, a villain of unimaginable evil and sophisticated reach. It was an image fed by destruction done and by American law enforcement eager to drive home the reality of his threat. In some ways, though, it was an image created because so little was known about how he worked.\n\nBut the trial, which left many of the details of the bombings uncontested, made clear that while Mr. bin Laden may be a global menace, his group, Al Qaeda, was at times slipshod, torn by inner strife, betrayal, greed and the banalities of life that one might find in any office.\n\n''To listen to some of the news reports a year or two ago, you would think bin Laden was running a top Fortune 500 multinational company -- people everywhere, links everywhere,'' said Larry C. Johnson, a former deputy director of the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism. ''What the evidence at trial has correctly portrayed, is that it's really a loose amalgam of people with a shared ideology, but a very limited direction.''\n\nThe trial also revealed evidence that tended to counter long-held assumptions about Mr. bin Laden's followers, who have long been portrayed as marching in ideological lock step, ready to pay any price, including death, for his cause.\n\nOne former Al Qaeda member, Jamal Ahmed Al-Fadl, a Sudanese man, said he had complained about his $500 monthly salary, which was lower than others', particularly Mr. bin Laden's Egyptian followers, who, he said, always seemed to receive preferential treatment. Another former accomplice, L'Houssaine Kherchtou, a Moroccan, testified that he grew disenchanted with Mr. bin Laden after he was refused $500 to cover the cost of an emergency operation for his wife.\n\nWhile no one was saying that Mr. bin Laden's ardent followers were concerned only with money, the disgruntlement felt by the two witnesses, and the feeling that they were being treated as ''second class,'' as Mr. Al-Fadl put it, ultimately led them to defect from Al Qaeda and into the hands of the American authorities.\n\nJessica E. Stern, a former member of the National Security Council in the Clinton administration and a terrorism expert at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, said, ''I think it has extremely important policy implications for how we understand terrorism.''\n\n''What we're learning through this trial,'' Ms. Stern added, ''is that it's sometimes more about greed than about grievance.''\n\nStill, testimony showed that Mr. bin Laden had enough followers willing to die for his cause that he remained as big a threat as ever.\n\nThe two former aides to Mr. bin Laden said Al Qaeda was also fractured over strategies and operations.\n\nMr. Kherchtou said that once, while Mr. bin Laden was based in Khartoum, he told his Libyan followers that they had to leave the country because Libya was pressuring the Sudanese government to expel all Libyans.\n\nMr. bin Laden offered each of the Libyan members of Al Qaeda $2,400 and plane tickets for themselves and their wives to leave, Mr. Kherchtou said. But the Libyans were so insulted, he said, that they refused Mr. bin Laden's offer. ''They were very upset and angry'' that Mr. bin Laden ''couldn't protect them,'' Mr. Kherchtou said.\n\nAnother time, Mr. Al-Fadl said, Egyptian members of Al Qaeda broke with Mr. bin Laden after Al Qaeda refused to mount an attack in retaliation for the 1993 arrest and imprisonment of an Egyptian sheik in New York who was convicted of  conspiring to blow up the United Nations and other city landmarks.\n\n''I remember some of the members in Al Qaeda, they left,'' Mr. Al-Fadl said. ''They say, 'No, we not going to stay in group' '' because Al Qaeda would not 'do anything to help Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman.' ''\n\nDefense lawyers tried to use traditional trial tactics to undermine the credibility of the two former bin Laden aides, and suggested that both men were motivated by greed in their decision to cooperate with the government, which had spent more than $1 million to provide them with new identities and lives through the witness protection program, testimony showed.\n\nIf the testimony at the bombings trial demystified Mr. bin Laden, it also filled in some of the blanks in the government's case. For example, the prosecution offered its most detailed account of the allegation that Mr. bin Laden sought to buy nuclear weapons, through Mr. Al-Fadl's testimony about an attempt to buy uranium.  But even Mr. Al-Fadl conceded that he did not know whether the uranium was genuine or if the deal went through.\n\nThere was enough circumstantial evidence, with hints of more in the pipeline, to prove the guilt of the four men on trial, and possibly also of Mr. bin Laden himself.\n\n''The case is there against him as well,'' said John F. Lewis Jr., a former assistant director of the F.B.I.'s national security division in Washington. ''It's exceedingly important because there are a lot of officials around the world who are not quite ready to accept that.''\n\nMr. Lewis added: ''We can link him to these things specifically. He's not necessarily choosing the targets, but he's approving them. And that's tantamount to being involved.''\n\nStill, prosecutors never introduced evidence directly showing that Mr. bin Laden ordered the embassy attacks.\n\nLast year, Ali A. Mohamed, a former adviser to Mr. bin Laden, pleaded guilty to terrorism conspiracy charges in New York, and told the judge that in 1994, he had been sent to scout out the American Embassy in Nairobi. He said he then showed his scouting file to Mr. bin Laden, who ''looked at the picture of the American Embassy and pointed to where a truck could go as a suicide bomber.''\n\nMr. bin Laden is believed to be in hiding in Afghanistan, under the protection of the ruling Taliban.\n\nAmerican law enforcement was trailing many of the top people in Mr. bin Laden's organization for years, and, as the trial showed, made real inroads into the operation.\n\nThe 1998 embassy bombings, carried out by a tight cell of operatives based in Kenya, killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and wounded thousands.\n\nOn Tuesday, a jury in Federal District Court in Manhattan convicted four of Mr. bin Laden's followers on all 302 counts they faced. Two of the men, Wadih El-Hage, a former personal secretary to Mr. bin Laden, and Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, a sworn member of his group, face life imprisonment, while two others who helped carry out the attacks, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali and Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, could be sentenced to death.\n\nIf there was one area in which prosecutors backed off in their public case against Mr. bin Laden, it was the decision to drop charges that Al Qaeda was responsible for the October 1993 killings of 18 American soldiers stationed in Somalia as part of a United Nations operation, as the original indictment charged.\n\nProsecutors had not argued that Al Qaeda members fired the weapons that shot down American Black Hawk helicopters and killed other soldiers on the ground, but the government had accused Al Qaeda of training the Somali fighters who had carried out the attacks.\n\nNear the conclusion of the trial, the judge, Leonard B. Sand of Federal  District Court in Manhattan, ordered the entire testimony of a pilot who described the ambush attack and the killings of the 18 American soldiers deleted from the record.\n\nProsecutors also edited the indictment before it was given to the jury to charge only that Mr. bin Laden had called for attacks on American soldiers in Somalia, and that Al Qaeda had trained Somali tribes opposed to United Nations intervention in that country.\n\nRobert B. Oakley, the government's special envoy to Somalia both before and after the attacks, has long been skeptical of allegations of Mr. bin Laden's involvement in the attacks by the Somalis, who he said were already fiercely anti-American.\n\nMr. Oakley, also a former State Department counterterrorism coordinator, said there was nothing about the trial that changed his mind, and that he would have been willing to testify to that belief for the defense if he had been called as a witness, which he was not.\n\n''In this thing, he didn't have a role,'' Mr. Oakley said of Mr. bin Laden about the Somali attacks. ''There was nothing he needed to add.''\n\nHe said, though, that he could understand why Mr. bin Laden might want to take credit for the attacks: ''because he wants to further enhance his image as the guy who's causing everything to happen against the United States around the world.''\n\nProsecutors said during the trial that Al Qaeda's role in Somalia was  important to an understanding of the mind-set of the group, and helped explain the evolution of the conspiracy to bomb the embassies. The government maintained that the Al Qaeda members who trained the fighters in Somalia came from the same Kenya cell that later carried out the attacks in Nairobi and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7, 1998.\n\nAnd prosecutors made clear in court, out of the presence of the jury, that they still believed that Al Qaeda, including at least one of those on trial, was responsible for the killings of the soldiers.\n\nIn shedding light on Mr. bin Laden's more private side, Mr. Al-Fadl  described bucolic days at Mr. bin Laden's farm near the Blue Nile in Sudan, where Mr. bin Laden liked to relax and where he and his followers, including a terrorist who had bombed the Egyptian Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan, rode horses, played soccer and swam.\n\nBut if the trial served to humanize Mr. bin Laden, it also showed that his  far-flung organization, with all of its cells, rules and secret codes, was -- at least this time -- not beyond the reach of American law.\n\n''For so long he'd been seen as this sort of untouchable, fearful, scary guy that we couldn't get our hands on,'' said Juliette N. Kayyem, executive director of the program on domestic preparedness at Harvard's Kennedy School and a former member of the National Commission on Terrorism.\n\nShe added: ''It's also a good reminder that trials and investigations and all those things that we sort of view as so slow and cumbersome can actually work.''\n\nTHE TERROR VERDICT: THE ORGANIZATION"

But the plan had a glitch.\n\n''They told me, 'We didn't see you because there was no light in the house,''' Hatch said after competing in Sunday's vault competition. ''They missed me, but their spirits were still here. Maybe they'll see me this time. Maybe they'll have electricity.''\n\nWith one mediocre vault and one good one, Hatch, a seven-time Cuban national champion, gave her family another chance to see her step onto the medals podium. On her first vault, she received a 9.4 because of a big step on the landing. On her second, after sticking the landing, she got a 9.481, high enough for second. Monica Rosu of Romania was first with a 9.656. Anna Pavlova of Russia was third.\n\nTwo of Hatch's teammates won medals, too, raising to seven the total medal count of the American women's and men's gymnasts. Terin Humphrey was second on the uneven bars, with a score of 9.662, followed by the national all-around champion, Courtney Kupets, with a 9.637. Emilie Lepennec of France won the event with a 9.687.\n\n''I think it was a pretty awesome finish,'' said Kelli Hill, the United States women's coach. ''We like seeing three girls compete today and three girls walk away with hardware.''\n\nThe Russian Svetlana Khorkina, who won a silver in the all-around event Thursday, did not finish her career with another Olympic medal. Instead, she flitted over and under the uneven bars, then dropped to the floor after messing up a pirouette. Looking disgusted, she walked away, zipped up her sweatsuit, grabbed her bag and stomped out of the arena. She received an 8.925.\n\nHatch, conversely, could not have been happier. With her face glowing and her blue eye-shadow sparkling, she was mesmerized by her second silver medal, staring at it and clutching the ribbon from which it hung.\n\nFor just a piece of metal, it meant so much. To Hatch, 26, it was a symbol of her toughness.\n\nLast year at the world championships, she tore the anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus in her left knee. She worked through pain to return to the national team and competed in only one event at these Games, the vault.\n\nAt the 1996 world championships, Hatch won a bronze in the vault and qualified for the Olympics. But she said the Cuban government lost her paperwork, and she did not end up competing at the Atlanta Games. She retired the next year, then married an American gymnastics coach, Alan Hatch, and moved to West Haven, Conn., where he owns a gym.\n\nFive years after retiring, she returned to gymnastics. On Sunday she received the reward for her long journey. ''It just feels like a story,'' she said, looking down at her medal. ''I feel special. I feel like a star.''\n\nSUMMER 2004 GAMES -- GYMNASTICS: WOMEN'S EVENT FINALS"

        "document": "A daylong hostage siege ended here early Thursday morning after two gunmen who had hijacked an Athens-bound commuter bus surrendered to the authorities and released their six remaining captives.\n\nThe gunmen, identified by the police as Albanians, earlier had threatened to blow up the bus and the six remaining hostages unless authorities met their demand for $1.3 million dollars and a plane to fly them out of the country.\n\nOne of the men, identifying himself as Hassan and speaking in broken Greek, phoned in the threat to a local television station about 14 hours after commandeering the bus at a suburban Athens bus stop.\n\nGreek officials said after the 18-hour standoff ended that the two men had no explosives with them, only a rifle and a pistol, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nOver the course of the day, 17 of the 23 passengers trapped on the bus had been freed by their captors. But the caller then told the Mega television station that no more would be released until the Greek authorities responded to his ultimatum.\n\nThe motives and backgrounds of the gunmen, who earlier asked for a plane to fly them to Russia, remained unclear. In his phone call, the man who called himself Hassan insisted he was Russian, not Albanian.\n\nGreek police commanders said the men had talked regularly with hostage negotiators by mobile phone. Some of the captives, who also spoke to relatives and local television stations on their cellphones, reported earlier that the men were nervous but were treating them well.\n\nGovernment officials had sought to reassure the public that the incident did not represent any broad threat to Greece's security. But Prime Minister Costas Caramanlis postponed his departure for a European Union summit meeting in Brussels to remain in Athens and monitor the situation.\n\nGreece has seen a spate of bus hijackings over the last five years, most of them ending with the police killing the hostage takers. In a 1999 case that shocked the country, a Greek hostage on a commandeered bus was shot and killed along with the young Albanian hostage taker.\n\nIn the years since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Greece has received tens of thousands of immigrants from neighboring Albania. Many were also recruited to work on the public works projects associated with last summer's Olympic Games in Athens.\n\nOn Wednesday, Greek antiterror squads, snipers in black ski masks and dozens of other police officers set up a cordon around the blue bus, which was left on the side of a store-lined highway. Traffic was backed up throughout the city, and relatives of captive passengers gathered at a nearby shopping center.\n\nThe bus was making its normal run from the city of Marathon when the gunmen got on board at a regular stop in the suburb of Geraka, about 10 miles east of downtown Athens. They brandished guns and a tote bag they said was filled with explosives, according to the police.\n\nThe bus driver slammed on the brakes, opened the doors and jumped out along with a woman passenger and the ticket collector, taking the ignition key with him. The bus was left on the side of the road, which was rebuilt this year for use in the 26-mile race from ancient Marathon that was a highlight of the Olympic Games.\n\nThere were no reports of injuries among the passengers, most of them Greeks on the way to work, although at one point a gunman fired through the roof of the bus."

''Isn't that enough for you?''\n\nArrested in Dubai in July 2001, Mr. Beghal initially confessed to interrogators there that he was the leader of a group planning to bomb the embassy under orders of Al Qaeda. He later retracted his confession, and on Monday, he told the court that he had confessed under ''methodical torture.''\n\nMr. Beghal was extradited to France later in 2001 and has been kept in solitary confinement ever since. On Monday in Paris's main criminal court, he spoke in fluid French, standing up to Judge Vandingenen, who repeatedly interrupted him during questioning.\n\nWhen the judge pressed him on his political ideology and whether he was part of an international ''holy war, '' Mr. Beghal said, ''It feels like we're in a court of the Inquisition.''\n\nJudge Vandingenen hit the table with his hand and declared the claim was untrue, adding that the court -- not the defendant -- was in charge of the proceedings.\n\nMr. Beghal further infuriated the judge by refusing to say why he had gone to live in Afghanistan.\n\nHe and the five other defendants are being tried for ''associating with criminals connected with a terrorist enterprise,'' a broadly defined crime that gives France powers to arrest, try and convict terrorism suspects.\n\nThe trial, which is expected to last seven weeks, is being conducted by three-judge panel, not a jury, as is typical in such cases in France. It follows a three-year investigation by France's top two antiterrorism judges, Jean-Louis Brugui\u00e8re and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ricard.\n\nIf convicted, the six defendants, who have proclaimed their innocence, face up to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn his statements to interrogators, Mr. Beghal provided what they said were details of the workings of several major cells in Europe, as well as the plot to bomb the American Embassy here. According to French officials, the plot was to have been carried out either with a car bomb or a suicide bomber wearing an explosives-rigged vest.\n\nMr. Beghal identified Nizar Trabelsi, a former professional soccer player of Tunisian origin, as the chosen suicide bomber, French and Belgian investigators say. Mr. Trabelsi is serving a 10-year sentence in Belgium for plotting to blow up a NATO base there on the orders of Al Qaeda."

China began cracking down on the triads in 1999, the year Portugal handed over the colony, stamping out most violent crime and making Macao safe instead for an invasion by American gambling companies.\n\nBeijing also broke the monopoly on gambling in Macao that Stanley Ho, a Hong Kong billionaire with a dozen small casinos here, held for four decades. With gambling illegal in most of East Asia, including the rest of China, Macao's casino industry is set to grow rapidly, with plans under way for a Vegas-like strip of 20 large casino resorts and 60,000 hotel rooms. The local government accepted bids for new gambling licenses in 2002, and the Sands is the first to open.\n\nThe wealthy Lui Chi Wo family of Hong Kong, the partner of Las Vegas Sands in the Sands Casino, is scheduled to open another here this summer. Wynn Resorts, led by the Las Vegas entrepreneur Stephen A. Wynn, plans to break ground this summer for a much larger casino, a project that had been delayed in part by a dispute over Macao's laws on extending credit to gamblers.\n\nThe big question now is how Mr. Ho's gambling empire, known here as S.J.M. -- short for the company's Portuguese name, Sociedade de Jogos de Macau -- will respond to the new competition.\n\nManuel Joaquim das Neves, the director of Macao's gambling regulatory agency, said in an interview here on Monday that he expected S.J.M. to conclude some kind of corporate alliance soon with MGM Mirage, which did not win a gambling license of its own here. ''I think very probably we will get an agreement, and we will get another operator in Macao,'' he said, adding that MGM might be allowed to open casinos as a subconcessionaire using S.J.M.'s gambling license.\n\nS.J.M. had no immediate comment Monday. A spokeswoman for MGM Mirage, Yvette Monet, said it was ''very interested in Macao -- if anything should become finalized, we will announce it accordingly.''\n\nBefore the Sands opened, there were questions about how many hard-core gamblers in the Chinese market would be willing to leave the low-ceiling haunts they had frequented for years. The Sands responded by offering dancers in skimpy blue outfits scampering in front of a soft-rock band, a 65-foot ceiling over the baccarat and blackjack tables, an indoor tea terrace offering 200 varieties of free tea, and slot machines that pay off with a triple 8, a lucky number in Chinese culture, instead of triple 7.\n\nThe combination appears to be working. The Sands was packed on Sunday evening and again on Monday afternoon, and was surprisingly busy even Monday morning. By contrast, there were more dealers than bettors in the cramped, smoky Oriental Casino next door on Sunday evening, and at Mr. Ho's flagship, the Lisboa Casino, on Monday morning.\n\nIn a written reply to questions about his new rivals, Mr. Ho struck a diplomatic tone. ''We welcome competition, as long as it is friendly and constructive to the economy,'' he wrote. ''We have lots of confidence in Macao's future, and we believe that under friendly competition, together we will contribute to the continuing healthy development of the gaming industry in Macao. The pie is going to be bigger and bigger, and we all could get a fair share of it.''\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Ho said it was too soon to assess the effects of the Sands on his own casinos.\n\nIn truth, Mr. Ho may gain over all even if his casinos falter in the short run, because his business interests extend beyond gambling to dominate the broad economy of Macao -- like Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China. He controls the hydrofoil ferries that make 80 hourlong trips a day across the Pearl River estuary between here and Hong Kong; he owns luxurious hotels like the Westin and the Mandarin Oriental, and the only television station; and he has stakes in the airport, a local airline, the electric utility and the racetrack.\n\nIf anything, the gambling market here appears likely to expand even faster than anyone expected because of developments in Hong Kong. China, trying to use economic growth to defuse a democracy movement there, has in the last year dropped many of the restrictions against individual visits by mainlanders to Hong Kong and Macao, while retaining those restrictions on travel elsewhere.\n\nA result has been a flood of tourists from an economy growing so fast that regulators are now trying to slow it down for fear of overheating. The number of mainlanders crossing the land border into Macao quadrupled the day the Sands opened.\n\nThe chairman of Las Vegas Sands is Sheldon G. Adelson, who built the Comdex computer industry trade show into one of the world's largest conventions and then sold the trade-show business in 1995 to Softbank of Japan for $860 million. Macao is now so important to him that he flies here from Las Vegas every four to six weeks.\n\nHe is about to trade in his Gulfstream 3 jet, which must land and refuel twice each way, for a Boeing Business Jet, a long-range 737 that can make it from Las Vegas to Macao with just one stop, and then cruise back again with the jet stream on its tail without stopping at all. Mr. Adelson said he had personally overseen a lengthy fitting out of the new jet's interior, including his private bedroom.\n\nThe gambling industry in Macao still faces problems, among them the large number of loan sharks. These lenders accompany borrowers to the gambling table and claim a share of any winnings as well as their principal and 10 percent interest, according to Fong Ka Chio, the research coordinator at the Institute for the Study of Commercial Gaming at the University of Macao. Losers are typically given a week or two after returning home to settle their debt, Mr. Fong said; after that, ''how they collect it, you can imagine.''\n\nMr. Wynn has argued strongly that Macao should start allowing the casinos themselves to provide credit to gamblers, in the form of chips. The territory's legislative assembly is close to passing the necessary legislation, but the bill does not now include provisions for casinos to write off bad debts against profit -- an important matter in Macao, which gets two-thirds of its tax revenue from a 35 percent tax and 3 percent surcharge on gross gambling profits. Mr. Joaquim das Neves said the deductibility question was a difficult one and that the city would not make a decision on it until next year.\n\nTwo senior colleagues of Mr. Joaquim das Neves, who was born in Macao and educated in Portugal, were shot in the neck in separate incidents during the violence of the late 1990's. One died instantly, at lunchtime next to the Lisboa Casino; the other survived.\n\nNext to such incidents, the disorder at the opening of the Sands last week paled; there were no serious injuries, although a few people were reported to have fainted in the crush. Mr. Adelson said he did not believe that any of his rivals in the gambling industry had started the free-chips rumor. Mr. Ho's newspaper, Jornal do Cidad\u00e3o, did not publish it.\n\nLei Siu Peng, acting commissioner of the Macao police, said in an interview at the city's aging colonial-style police headquarters on Monday that his investigators suspected that some travel agents might have started the free-chips rumor to lure more visitors into buying tickets to come here. But he acknowledged this would be difficult to prove.\n\nJust the same, he said, the police are considering buying some sturdier crowd-control barriers."

        "document": "Other than bruising a spectator with another 150-mile-an-hour serve, Andy Roddick did nearly everything right Sunday when many would have excused him for not doing anything at all.\n\nThe United States had already clinched its first-round Davis Cup series against Austria, and Roddick had already pleased fans with a decisive victory on Friday. But he played anyway on Sunday and made quick work of his match-turned-exhibition against Jurgen Melzer, 6-4, 6-2, before a crowd of 5,936 at Mohegan Sun Arena. Robby Ginepri later beat Stefan Koubek, 7-5, 6-2, to complete a 5-0 shutout.\n\nThe scores did not matter. The circumstances did not matter. But to Roddick, the commitment did.\n\n''I feel a pretty good obligation to the fans that make Davis Cup possible,'' he said. ''To be honest, it's a pretty easy decision. Robby and I are on the same plane tonight to San Jose, so I wasn't leaving until he was leaving anyway.''\n\nPatrick McEnroe, the United States captain, and his crew hoped that the sweep, albeit over a weak Austrian team with no singles player ranked higher than 76th, would underscore a renewed commitment to Davis Cup.\n\nA previous generation that included Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi developed a reputation for being reluctant to play. Roddick said he did not think that reputation was accurate, but he said, ''We're a closer unit than that team was.''\n\n''I'm very committed to playing Davis Cup,'' Roddick said. ''I love the guys I'm with. That has a lot to do with it.''\n\nWhether friendship matters will be further revealed when the United States plays host to Sweden in a quarterfinal April 9 to 11.\n\nThe site, which must be decided within 14 days, will probably be in Florida, California or Arizona, a spokesman for the United States Tennis Association said.\n\nSweden ousted the defending champion, Australia, 4-1, with Jonas Bjorkman and Thomas Enqvist winning the final two singles matches Sunday.\n\nThe last time the Swedes played the United States, they won the 1997 final, 5-0.\n\n''These guys personally don't remember that, but I'll try to remind them of that in the coming months,'' McEnroe said.\n\nThat defeat was among a string of disappointments for the United States, which has not won the Davis Cup since 1995. McEnroe said he would like to build an era of dominance.\n\nRoddick said: ''Well, yeah, but we have got to get through this one first. You have to get to that first tier before you can become perennial favorites. Obviously, I think it excites Patrick like it does the rest of us that we have a pretty young core of guys who are very willing and very eager to play.''\n\nThe quartet that played here -- Roddick, ranked third; Ginepri, ranked 25th; and the doubles specialists Bob and Mike Bryan -- appeared inseparable. They spoke of their bonhomie, telling tales of friendly battles in Ping-Pong and arcade games.\n\n''It's not anything that's canned or that we talk about,'' McEnroe said. ''It is real. I think that the more they enjoy themselves, I think it has a big effect on the court.''\n\nGinepri said: ''It's extremely important to have a good relationship on and off the court. It makes it more fun, more energetic, more positive.''\n\nMcEnroe made no guarantees about who would play against Sweden. The only lock is Roddick, who said he thought that he had room for improvement.\n\nRoddick has tinkered with his serve under his coach, Brad Gilbert. Although the controlled indoor environment here let him use brute force to blast two more serves of 150 m.p.h. on Sunday -- he set the record in his match Friday -- Roddick is thinking more location than speed.\n\n''You can't have people sitting on your fastball,'' said Roddick, who delayed a news conference to apologize to Joan Sweeney of Tampa, Fla., who had Roddick's first serve of the match ricochet off her shoulder and neck. He posed for a picture with her, and she later wore an ice pack.\n\nThree Nations Advance\n\nSpain, last year's Davis Cup runner-up, defeated the Czech Republic, 3-2, in a first-round match yesterday in Brno, Czech Republic. Rafael Nadal, at 17 the youngest man to play for Spain in the Davis Cup, topped Radek Stepanek, 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4), 6-3, in the deciding match.\n\nFeliciano L\u00f3pez started the comeback for Spain by beating Tomas Berdych, 6-4, 6-7 (2), 6-3, 6-4. Spain was without its injured stars Juan Carlos Ferrero and Carlos Moya.\n\nSpain will meet the Netherlands in a quarterfinal in April.\n\nMartin Verkerk beat Frank Dancevic of Canada, 6-7 (5) 6-2, 7-5, 6-3, yesterday in Maastricht, the Netherlands, to send the Dutch team into the quarterfinals. In the final match, Sjeng Schalken defeated Simon Larose of Canada, 6-2, 7-5, to make it 4-1.\n\nTop-ranked Roger Federer overpowered Andrei Pavel of Romania, 6-3, 6-2, 7-5, in Bucharest to give Switzerland a first-round victory. Switzerland won, 3-2, after Victor Hanescu beat the Swiss reserve Stanislas Wawrinka, 6-3, 7-6 (3). Switzerland will play host to France in April. (AP)  TENNIS"

        "document": "The Bush administration insists that it can hold American citizens in secret as long as it wants, without access to lawyers, simply by calling them ''enemy combatants.'' A New York federal appeals court heard a challenge to that policy this week by the so-called dirty bomber, Jose Padilla. The administration's position makes a mockery of the Constitution and puts every American's liberty at risk. It is important that the court strike it down, and give Mr. Padilla the rights he has been denied.\n\nMr. Padilla is an American citizen who was taken into custody in Chicago in May 2002. The government suspects him of being part of a ''dirty bomb'' plot by Al Qaeda, but it has not charged him. Instead, it has labeled him an enemy combatant and locked him up in a naval brig in South Carolina. He has been held there nearly 18 months, with no indication of when he will be tried or released. He has not been allowed to meet with a lawyer, despite a lower court ruling that he should be.\n\nOf all the post-Sept. 11 denials of civil liberties, the enemy combatant doctrine is among the worst. It gives the president untrammeled authority to lock up Americans merely by asserting that they are part of a terrorist plot. In its argument to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit this week, the government insisted that military-style rules like the enemy combatant doctrine now apply to American citizens, even on American soil, because Al Qaeda has ''made the battlefield the United States.''\n\nGovernments are always tempted to detain perceived enemies without charges, hold them incommunicado and deny them counsel. But the framers of the Constitution knew that if the government was allowed to act on those impulses, the result would be tyranny. That is why they built into this nation's founding document the very rights the Bush administration is intent on taking away.\n\nFortunately, it appears from this week's argument that the appeals court panel saw through the administration's spurious justifications. ''As terrible as 9/11 was,''' Judge Rosemary Pooler observed, ''it didn't repeal the Constitution.''"

An exciting Japanese team played with flair throughout, continually taking the game to its Belgian opponent.\n\nFor the Japanese hosts, the one big flaw in this tableau was the result: a 2-2 draw that must have left the Belgians as pleased as they were surprised.\n\nJapan had a right to be disappointed, considering it had most of the momentum and held a lead with less than 20 minutes left in the match. With only five minutes left in an intensely fought second half, midfielder Junichi Inamoto put the ball past the Belgian goalie for the second time. It would have put Japan ahead, 3-2, and made Inamoto, who plays for Arsenal in the English Premier League, an instant national hero.\n\nUnfortunately for Japan, in a call that will be endlessly second-guessed here, the referee, William Mattus of Costa Rica, ruled that Inamoto had fouled a Belgian defender before his shot.\n\n''I didn't even hear the whistle,'' Inamoto, who was named man of the match, said. ''I don't know why it wasn't allowed -- I did nothing wrong.''\n\nIf the result tonight was not exactly the one Japan had hoped for, there were many bright spots. Japan had lost all three of its matches in its first World Cup appearance, in France in 1998, and a draw against a Belgian squad that has appeared in six consecutive World Cup finals is progress.\n\nBetter yet, though, was the sheer verve shown by Japan, only four of whose players play in Europe. As expected, the team's star, Hidetoshi Nakata, gleamed, flashing moves worthy of the stylish Brazilians.\n\nMore than the individual brilliance, the team played as a unit, starting each half a bit on the defensive but quickly shaking off the stress of the occasion or the pressure from fans and firing on all cylinders.\n\nJapan's first real chance came about 11 minutes into the match in what would be a scoreless first half. It was a shot from the right side of the penalty area that drew Belgium goalie Geert De Vlieger out of the goal box for a difficult save.\n\nThe second half brought all the real action, and goals, although Belgium's captain, Marc Wilmots, opened the scoring in the 57th minute with a spectacular bicycle kick from directly in front of the goal.\n\nThroughout the match, Belgium attacked with gusto. The problem, rather, was a defense that often seemed to break down.\n\nBarely two minutes after Belgium scored, Takayuki Suzuki took a pass from Shinji Ono, slipped past a Belgian defender and evened the score, unleashing a wave of pandemonium among the Japanese fans.\n\nEight minutes later, Inamoto scored as he shrugged off a Belgian defender and shot the ball past De Vlieger. But in the 75th minute, Peter Van Der Heyden escaped his defender on the left side to chip in a shot from the edge of the penalty area.\n\n''We can consider this point as a historic one, because it's the first point Japan have gained in a World Cup,'' Philippe Troussier, Japan's French coach said, using history to put the night's effort in a brighter context. ''I'm satisfied because everything is still possible in the next two matches, and I think we have a strong chance.''\n\nSOCCER"

        "document": "The mile was once the glamour race of track and field, the race that made international heroes of Glenn Cunningham, Jim Ryun, Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett. The most memorable race in history may have been Roger Bannister's breakthrough in 1954, when he became the first to run a mile in faster than four minutes.\n\nBut in recent years, the slightly shorter 1,500 meters has been run at most major meets, and the mile has been all but swept aside. The attraction is still there, however, and last night the mile regained the spotlight, at least for the 3 minutes 43.13 seconds it took Hicham el-Guerrouj of Morocco to shatter the world record.\n\nThe performance came during the Golden Gala meet in Rome's Olympic Stadium.\n\nAlthough the 24-year-old el-Guerrouj has only lost twice in four years, he has not entranced the track and field public, at least in the United States, the way such runners as Michael Johnson, Marion Jones, Haile Gebrselassie and Maurice Greene have.\n\nPerhaps el-Guerrouj (pronounced el gah-ROODGE) will now. He broke the six-year-old world record of 3:44.39 by Noureddine Morceli of Algeria, set in Rieti, Italy. Had they run their record races head to head, el-Guerrouj would have beaten Morceli by 10 yards. Had el-Guerrouj run his record race against Bannister's historic time of 3:59.4, he would have beaten the Englishman by 120 yards.\n\nEl-Guerrouj's record race gave him all four world records outdoors and indoors in the mile and the 1,500 meters. He made it clear before the race that he wanted this record and said, ''If I'm helped by the weather conditions and by Roman fans, I can do it.''\n\nOn a hot night, the spectators did their part, the Kenyan pace setters did theirs and Noah Ngeny of Kenya kept the pressure on el-Guerrouj over the last 200 meters. In paced races, the record breakers usually finish far ahead, but el-Guerrouj won by only four and a half feet.\n\nNgeny's second-place time of 3:43.40 was the second fastest ever. Rui Silva of Portugal ran third in 3:50.91 and Andres  Diaz of Spain fourth in 3:51.15, also career bests.\n\nAfter the race, to wild cheering, el-Guerrouj ran a victory lap, waving a Moroccan flag.\n\n''I'm just very, very happy,'' he said. ''I went so fast past the clock that I didn't know at first what I had done. I needed to bring some happiness to my family as my uncle died recently. Rome is a magic track for me.''\n\nEl-Guerrouj is 5 feet 9 1/4 inches and 128 pounds. His first big performance came in 1992, a third place in the 5,000 meters in the world junior championships. Since then, he has concentrated on the mile and the 1,500 meters, which is almost 120 yards less than a mile.\n\nA year ago last night, in the same Rome meet, he broke Morceli's 1,500-meter record by running 3:26. Conversion tables used by track and field statisticians equated that time to a 3:42.5 mile.\n\nIn a 10-day span in February 1997, over smaller tracks, he set the existing world indoor records of 3:31.18 for 1,500 meters and 3:48.45 for the mile. He won the world 1,500-meter championship outdoors in 1997 and indoors in 1995 and 1997.\n\nIn 1996, when he won 12 of 13 races at 1,500 meters and the mile, his only loss came in the Atlanta Olympics, where he fell just before the start of the last lap and finished 12th. Morceli won that race, but knew his successor was in place.\n\n''He is a great athlete,'' Morceli said of el-Guerrouj. ''He has a good future.''\n\nAt 1,500 meters and the mile, el-Guerrouj won 14 of 15 races in 1997, finishing second in the mile in the Grand Prix final. He won 12 of 12 last year.\n\nThe Rome winners last night included Jones, Greene, Michael Johnson and Allen Johnson, all from the United States, and Wilson Kipketer of Denmark.\n\nJones, who has not lost at 100, 200 or 400 meters in four years, easily won the women's 200 in 22.18 seconds. Greene, who set a world record a month ago of 9.79 seconds for the men's 100 meters, won the Rome 100 in 9.85 seconds, a time only he and Donovan Bailey of Canada have ever bettered.\n\nMichael Johnson, who missed the United States championships three week ago with a strained quadricep muscle, ran his first 200-meter race in six weeks and won in 19.93 seconds. Allen Johnson beat his countrymen Mark Crear and Larry Wade in the men's 110-meter hurdles in 13.01 seconds.\n\nBut the star of the night was el-Guerrouj, and he said he was not done. After his race, he suggested he could run faster -- 1,500 meters in 3:24, the mile in 3:41 or 3:42.\n\nTRACK AND FIELD"

        "document": "Leaders of the Taliban and the Northern Alliance were poised to strike a deal today at the expense of thousands of foreign Taliban fighters trapped in Kunduz, in northeast Afghanistan.\n\nThe leaders began arriving tonight in Emam Sahib, about 30 miles north of here, for negotiations on the fate of the Taliban fighters in the besieged city. The Northern Alliance general in charge in northeastern Afghanistan, Daoud Khan, said thousands of Afghan Taliban soldiers in Kunduz appeared willing to surrender. A senior Taliban leader was said to be on his way to Mazar-i-Sharif to talk to commanders there.\n\nBut shut out of the talks are the non-Afghans fighting with the Taliban, thousands of men from Pakistan and other Muslim countries who retreated to Kunduz as the Northern Alliance rolled through. General Khan said the foreigners, who refugees say have executed hundreds of Afghan Taliban who tried to surrender, are not even being told of the negotiations.\n\n''We are not speaking for the foreigners,'' General Khan said at his headquarters here. ''They have no part in the negotiations.''\n\nToday's developments raised the prospect of a grisly end to the siege, which began last week when the Northern Alliance cut off all roads leading out of the city. According to refugees, foreign Taliban fighters have vowed to fight to the death. They are apparently so distrustful of their Afghan counterparts that they have barred them from many parts of the city.\n\nThe prospects for an evacuation seem slim. General Khan said he would consider allowing a United Nations-sponsored evacuation of the foreign fighters, but he has not asked for one. United Nations officials said today that they had been contacted by representatives of the Taliban about a possible evacuation, but that they did not have the means to carry one out. They urged the forces surrounding the city to respect the conventions of war regarding humane treatment of the defeated.\n\nEarlier this week, Red Cross officials scouring the battlefield outside Kabul found the bodies of 30 men, believed to be foreigners fighting for the Taliban, of whom at least half had apparently been executed.\n\nIn Washington, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld ruled out allowing Kunduz's defenders to escape. ''It would be most unfortunate if the foreigners in Afghanistan -- the Al Qaeda and the Chechens and others who have been there working with the Taliban -- if those folks were set free and in any way allowed to go to another country and cause the same kind of terrorist acts,'' he said.\n\nNorthern Alliance commanders said they were not contemplating a plan in which turncoat Afghan Taliban soldiers inside Kunduz would attack the foreigners. But they reiterated their stark ultimatum to the foreigners: surrender for trial or die.\n\n''If they resist, I am sure they will be killed,'' General Khan said.\n\nHundreds more Afghan Taliban soldiers defected today to the Northern Alliance. At the same time, reports surfaced that the foreign Taliban fighters had killed Afghans trying to defect. Together, the defections and the reports of mass killings conveyed an impression of near-chaos among the Taliban in Kunduz.\n\nNorthern Alliance leaders said they would wait at least until the end of the week for the negotiations to play out; after that, they said, they would be ready to attack.\n\nForeigners have made up a large part of the Taliban's army since its inception in 1994. The foreign Taliban are considered to be among the most committed in the movement.\n\nThe Northern Alliance says some 20,000 Taliban troops are hunkered down in Kunduz, including as many as 6,000 foreigners. Pentagon officials estimate that only about 3,000 Taliban troops are holed up. By either estimate, Kunduz is one of the largest Taliban strongholds left.\n\nGeneral Khan said many Afghan Taliban fighters in Kunduz had asked for safe passage to Kandahar, the spiritual home of the Taliban, which is also under attack on all sides. He said he and his commanders were considering the request.\n\nAs the siege dragged on, there were signs of deepening division among the Taliban in Kunduz.\n\nOvernight, two Afghan Taliban commanders walked across the front lines with about 350 soldiers, handed over their weapons and declared allegiance to the Northern Alliance. The soldiers said that the defections were negotiated in secret, and that they came across at night to avoid being shot by foreign Taliban.\n\n''We left very quietly,'' said Muhammad Israel, one of the Taliban commanders who came to Taliqan. ''If we had left during the day, the foreigners would have killed us.''\n\nCommander Israel echoed reports here that foreign Taliban soldiers had carried out several killings of Afghans trying to defect. Refugees and Northern Alliance officials have said that foreign Taliban fighters have killed as many as 450 Afghan comrades. Refugees have also reported that more than three dozen young Uzbek and Tajik men were gunned down by foreign fighters who suspected that they were trying to cross the front lines.\n\nNorthern Alliance commanders added another report to that list today. They said that on Monday, foreign fighters had killed 200 Afghan Taliban at Angurbagh, a village near the Kunduz airport, when the Afghans tried to cross the front lines.\n\nNone of the reports could be confirmed.\n\n''All the Afghans are going to defect from the Taliban,'' said Abdullah Bashir, a Taliban soldier who defected this morning. ''The Afghans are tired of fighting. We want to go home.''\n\nIndeed, the scene at General Khan's headquarters, where the defecting Taliban soldiers had gathered, seemed like a homecoming.\n\nCommander Israel said that he and his men were sitting around a fire at sunset on Monday, breaking their Ramadan fast with bowls of chicken soup. They talked about it for a few moments, he said, and then decided it was time to go.\n\n''I got on the radio, talked to General Daoud, and he sent some soldiers over to meet us,'' he said.\n\nBy his own reckoning, Commander Israel's decision to join the Taliban five years ago was made with no more deliberation than if he had been picking out a new turban.\n\n''There was a man I was feuding with who was in the Northern Alliance at the time,'' he said, ''So I decided to go with the Taliban.''\n\nCommander Israel said he never identified with the strict Islamic code of the Taliban, and never brutalized civilians the way they did. As an ethnic Tajik, he said he went easy on the locals, who were largely from his own ethnic group.\n\nThe locals in Taliqan seemed to sympathize. As the commander strolled around the general's courtyard, an old acquaintance, Nur Ahmed, walked up and embraced him.\n\n''My friend,'' Mr. Ahmed said, wrapping his arms around Commander Israel. ''How have you been?''\n\nA NATION CHALLENGED: A BATTLEFIELD"

        "document": "It will be Magnus Norman versus Gustavo Kuerten in the French Open final Sunday, but anyone who had the good fortune to spend 3 hours 38 minutes watching the second semifinal today knows that it could very easily have been Magnus Norman versus Juan Carlos Ferrero instead.\n\nThree years ago, Kuerten came to Roland Garros as a 20-year-old and won hearts, minds and eventually the tournament by beating up on his elders. For much of today's match, Kuerten must have felt as if he were seeing his own reflection across the net.\n\nFerrero is the one who is 20 this year, the one who lashed his ground strokes with insouciance and precision, the one chasing down and trumping the best efforts of more experienced men. And when the Spaniard took a two-set-to-one lead and then broke Kuerten's serve early in the fourth set to take a 3-1 lead, it appeared that his very first French Open would be a debut for tennis historians to remember.\n\n''It felt so close,'' said Ferrero, whose rise has been so swift that he was seeded 16th here.\n\nBut Kuerten, the fifth-seeded Brazilian who wears a wide bandanna, was not ready to congratulate Ferrero just yet. Despite a sore back and sore legs, Kuerten somehow summoned the energy to start finding the lines again and won in five sets, 7-5, 4-6, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3.\n\nNorman, who is seeded No. 3 and has lost only one set this tournament, expended a great deal less energy and emotion in his victory today in defeating Franco Squillari, the unseeded Argentine left-hander, 6-1, 6-4, 6-3, to reach his first Grand Slam final.\n\n''I was expecting maybe a tougher match, but that was his first semifinal, so maybe his nerves were a little bit like mine down in Australia,'' said Norman, who had great difficulty keeping the ball in the court when he lost his first Grand Slam semifinal at the Australian Open this year.\n\nThis time, the Swede had no such difficulty, picking on Squillari's weaker backhand swing. Norman is a powerful athlete and a complete tennis player who, with his white cap, sturdy build and Calvinist work ethic, is reminiscent of Jim Courier at his peak, but with a much more penetrating serve and two-handed backhand and better technique at the net.\n\nNorman's lopsided victory was merely a prelude to the best match of the men's tournament thus far, and what made it good was the percussive brilliance of both men from the backcourt and Kuerten's ability to ignore the signals his skinny body was sending him.\n\n''He won that match with his shots, but he really won it with his heart,'' said Patrice Hagelauer, a former French Davis Cup coach who, like many people, left the stands feeling a bit weak in the knees.\n\nThis was Kuerten's second consecutive five-set match. In the quarterfinals, he survived despite trailing by two sets to one against Yevgeny Kafelnikov, with Kafelnikov up by 4-2 in the fourth set and serving at 40-15. Kuerten prevailed largely because Kafelnikov's play dropped off dramatically.\n\nThis time, Kuerten lifted his game in a hurry and Ferrero's game dropped off only slightly. The change came with Ferrero up a break and leading by 3-2. On the changeover, Kuerten received treatment on his chronically tight lower back, which has been bothering him since February.\n\nKuerten then broke Ferrero in the next game with a backhand volley winner to get back to 3-3 and then broke him again in a terrific and hard-fought 10th game to even the match. Down the stretch, the difference was in the details: Kuerten's better serve, his willingness to push forward and his experience.\n\n''I think we played one of the best matches here, great performance,'' Kuerten said. ''The crowd was so into it. It was great to be there. In the fifth set, I was so pumped up. That's the feeling we always try to experience on court. Today was that kind of day. Even if I went off court losing in five sets, I was going to be satisfied.''\n\nInstead, he got the chance to be ecstatic, raising both arms triumphantly and turning his handshake with Ferrero into a hug.\n\n''He pushed me close to my limit; I really had to do everything right to beat him,'' Kuerten said.\n\nKuerten also said that he still had some energy left for his encounter Sunday with Norman.\n\n''I think I'm very strong now,'' Kuerten said, ''and I think I'm going to be even stronger in the final.''\n\nThe question is, should Norman believe him?\n\nTENNIS"

        "document": "With oil prices climbing to a 13-year high after two deadly attacks on oil installations within a week, security has become the central preoccupation of Mideast oil producers.\n\nThe killing last Saturday of five Western contractors at Saudi Arabia's western oil hub in Yanbu and the attempted suicide bombing of Iraq's main oil export terminals on April 24 have raised market-rattling fears that oil workers and facilities may be Al Qaeda's new targets of choice.\n\nThe price of crude oil jumped above $40 a barrel in New York on Friday, its highest level since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. It eventually settled at $39.93, up 56 cents from Thursday's price. For months, high demand and tight supplies have pushed the price of oil upward.\n\nMost countries are producing at or near maximum capacity, and the only country with spare capacity is Saudi Arabia. Iraq's barrels are also badly needed. While last week's attacks did not do great damage, traders worry that a more serious disruption of Middle East oil production remains possible and that it would shake the fragile stability of the already strained oil market.\n\n''It's the combination of fears of what might happen and the fundamental tightness of the market that has sent prices higher,'' said Leonidas P. Drollas, chief economist with the Center for Global Energy Studies, a London consulting firm.\n\nSaudi refineries, pipelines and ports in Eastern Province, home to Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer, are widely seen as relatively well-fortified targets.\n\nBut the incidents at Yanbu, where oil is exported to North America and Europe, and at Iraq's only gulf outlet, exposed vulnerabilities that require swift remedies, analysts and oil industry executives said.\n\n''What you really have in these two incidents is a new phase, a new type of attack,'' said Walid Khaduri, editor of The Middle East Economic Survey, based in Cyprus. ''And the common denominator in both is a lack of security. So the only thing that countries can do is more and more security.''\n\nIn Yanbu, guards had been posted at the entrances to the sprawling residential area for foreign workers and at the adjacent petrochemical industry complex. But they were armed, if at all, with handguns, according to contractors at the site.\n\nTheir pistols were no match for the heavy weapons used by the Saudi gunmen who killed the employees of the Texas-based ABB Lummis. They had semiautomatic rifles and went on a rampage in a stolen truck through the neighborhood, dragging the body of one victim. After they were cornered and killed, witnesses said one attacker was wearing what appeared to be a vest rigged with explosives.\n\nThe earlier incident in the waters off Basra, in southern Iraq, involved three small boats laden with bombs. One blew up when American sailors pulled alongside for a routine check as the boat approached the Khawr al- Amaya terminal, killing three of the sailors. The attackers' other two boats were destroyed as they raced toward the Basra loading dock.\n\nThe attacks were widely attributed to Al Qaeda or independent terror groups it has inspired. Three weeks before the Iraq attack, a specific threat against oil installations was made in a statement posted on a radical Internet site that was signed by Abdulaziz al-Muqrin, the presumed Qaeda leader in Saudi Arabia.\n\n''Strikes on oil wells and pipelines in Iraq may lead to the withdrawal of foreign companies or at least destroy the security and stability needed by them to plunder the wealth of Muslims,'' the posting said.\n\nThe fear of further attacks has set off a small, but possibly temporary, exodus of foreign workers. All 90 Lummis employees at Yanbu were evacuated, at their request, and other companies have offered their workers similar options.\n\n''Our company has urged dependents to go home for now, because upgrading security here will take a month or so,'' said Max Wilks, an executive with Saudi Arabian Parsons Ltd., an affiliate of the Parsons Corporation of California, which has provided management services to the Yanbu project since it began in 1979.\n\nHe said a few of Parsons' 160 foreign staff members had already resigned. ''All the others are either going to stay or are in the undecided mode,'' added Mr. Wilks, who has worked at Yanbu for more than 20 years and has decided to stay.\n\nSome foreign oil workers are now also calling for more intensive background checks of the Saudis who work alongside them, based on the disclosure that three of the Yanbu attackers worked at Yanpet, a company inside the industrial zone.\n\nThe topic dominated a meeting between American businessmen and the American ambassador to Saudi Arabia last Sunday, said David Cantrell, president of the American Business Association here.\n\n''Probably 30 of the 60 minutes were taken up by that subject,'' he added. ''I said if we could just find a company to vet the Saudi employees, it would be the next big thing. At the moment there is no mechanism to do it.''\n\nBut the Saudi culture, and the government's official campaign to force companies to hire locally, could risk irritating local sensitivities.\n\n''This is still a tribal society, and it's traditional that someone is vouched for because he's a cousin or a relative,'' said one longtime expatriate worker here. Saudi oil ministry officials, in any case, have insisted that they scrutinize all oil sector hirings.\n\nBut other security suggestions were adopted almost immediately after the Yanbu attack.\n\nSandbagged checkpoints run by uniformed members of Saudi Arabia's elite National Guard were quickly set up outside hotels and housing compounds catering to foreign oil workers. Outside the Holiday Inn, which abuts a large housing compound for expatriate oil workers, a maze of concrete barriers was put up to slow approaching cars.\n\nArmored vehicles with machine guns patrol the perimeter of the port and industrial complex, and Saudi officials have been meeting daily with Western workers.\n\n''Our Westerners want to see more guards, armed vehicles and heavier weapons, which we didn't like to see one week ago,'' said Mohammed Abdulaziz al-Juwaiser, the director general of the Royal Commission in Yanbu, which administers the oil industry development zone. ''They have started to ask for more forces on the ground, especially around the work area.''\n\nHe said the government was ready to meet their demands, but he cautioned that no one could provide an air-tight guarantee of safety against determined killers and terrorists. ''You cannot build fences and put a guard around every person,'' Mr. Juwaiser said. ''This is a city where people come and go.''\n\nAramco workers appeared less worried, noting that their operations have been in the line of fire for years, especially after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait when Saddam Hussein fired Scud missiles at the kingdom. The Saudi military as well as Aramco's own 5,000-strong security force monitor the pipelines, including the strategic line of pipes that carry gas and crude oil from the wells in Eastern Province across 750 miles of desert to the plants and port at Yanbu.\n\nBut the Saudi government takes the danger of further terrorist attacks seriously and, after a long period of complacency, has been aggressively searching for Al Qaeda operatives, killing a number of suspects in recent weeks.\n\nTheir own citizens have also become victims. Last May, 35 people were killed when suicide bombers rammed into a residential compound in Riyadh that housed both foreigners and Saudis. A car bomb attack last week at a crowded police headquarters in Riyadh left 5 people dead and 145 people wounded."

        "document": "WHY did they boo? Surely these people knew that Serena Williams, as she said, is just a kid, only 19. It was her sister Venus who defaulted their semifinal match minutes before they were due on court, not her, and did they even consider that Venus's knee might have really been hurt?\n\nThe tennis fans at Indian Wells in the Southern California desert only knew they were out a match they eagerly wanted to watch. They booed the next night at the sight of Venus and her father, Richard, on the way to their seats, and they booed Serena in the process of defeating Kim Clijsters in the final.\n\nAs much as this was ''a sad thing, an unfortunate thing and in many ways unfair,'' Andre Agassi's own experiences and a hard-earned perspective told him that restitution could be made and respect reinforced not by shaking a fist (Richard's response to the hissing fans) but by looking within. By admitting that the family could have managed the situation in a more professional way.\n\n''You only hope that the things that happen to a person in that kind of scope, that kind of spotlight, are things that you think about in a very significant way on your own personal time,'' said Agassi, who won the men's title Sunday over Pete Sampras. ''Make assessments and judgments on how you want things to go in the future, and realize that those things are in your control. I would just consider it an opportunity to understand what people come to expect when we're out there playing the way we play, making the money we make, and you've got to be responsible and accountable for yourself.''\n\nFrom the high ground Agassi has reached in the decade he has on the Williams sisters, he could look at Venus's messy default  and see the younger version of himself. At the Williamses' age, and even older, Agassi was every bit the prodigy who played it his way, on his terms, without apparent consideration or concern for what people thought.\n\nAt 30, in the process of dramatically recasting the underachiever's role tennis historians had already written for him, Agassi could advise the Williams sisters that public perception will invariably intrude on your reality, and therefore must be acknowledged.\n\n''The most significant loser is the game of tennis,'' he said. ''You never want to see a default under any situation in the semifinals, let alone one that is surrounded with controversy.''\n\nHe wasn't saying that Venus had deliberately bailed on the match, and neither am I. ''I don't like guessing,'' Agassi said.\n\nIn fact, the condition of Venus's knee had come up when she had worn a wrap to a postmatch interview two days earlier and said it was sore.\n\nThe truth is, there is usually too much speculation regarding most Williams sisters matters, along with strident critiques of their sartorial, social and scheduling agendas. Most amazing is the common complaint that they don't play enough, as if being a tennis drone should be any young woman's goal. If the Williamses can beam on and off the tour, enjoy other aspects of life and still win, I say more power to them.\n\nOne of the alternatives, as we've seen time and again, is to play, play, play and burn out. Think Jennifer Capriati would have preferred the Venus and Serena approach? Even Agassi, suddenly making a late-innings run at attaching himself to Sampras's side forever, like McEnroe to Borg, doesn't play the what-if game.\n\n''Who's to say if I had done all this earlier, as far as my training and intensity, that my mind or focus or body could have held up through the years?'' he said.\n\nThere is a big difference, though, between independence and impudence. A stadium full of fans that watched Venus demolish Elena Dementieva the day before she withdrew is not the neighborhood park where daddy set the rules. Far-fetched or not, many people do believe that the Williamses' Wimbledon semifinal last summer was staged and that honest competition is secondary to Richard's grand family plan.\n\n''If my dad were to do that, why would Venus be up, 4-1?'' Serena asked. ''Wouldn't it be more even?''\n\nFair questions, but Venus's decision to default so close to match time without even trying to play was tantamount to her canceling a date by not showing up. It was a refusal to concede that there are even misconceptions about what she and Serena will do, or what their father will have them do. The booing was less for the act than it was for the attitude, and in many ways it was not unfair."

The blast killed the children and three other civilians and wounded seven, the official said.\n\nThe American command on Tuesday gave its account of a disputed raid on a Shiite mosque in Baghdad late Monday that infuriated many in the Shiite community and led some to question their cooperation with the latest American-led security plan.\n\nAccording to an American military statement, Iraqi soldiers stormed the mosque, in the mostly Shiite neighborhood of Kadhimiya in northwestern Baghdad, in search of suspected militants. About 50 people were temporarily detained during the raid, but nobody was arrested and no bomb-making materials were discovered, military officials said.\n\nContrary to claims made by neighbors and Shiite community leaders, the American command said its soldiers had remained outside the building during the entire operation. Past American raids of mosques have provoked bitterness among Muslims here, who resent having their sacred spaces dragged into the war.\n\nAfter the raid, the joint American-Iraqi force came under attack by about 20 gunmen firing rocket-propelled grenades and small arms, according to the military statement. The Americans returned fire, the statement said, killing three people it described as insurgents.\n\nShiite community leaders and residents in the neighborhood of the raid gave a significantly different account. They said American forces had stormed not one but two mosques, both linked to Moktada al-Sadr, the anti-American Shiite cleric.\n\nAs the soldiers entered one of the mosques they opened fire on worshipers who tried to flee, said Salah Abdul Qadir, the spokesman for the Shiite Endowment, a government organization that supervises all Shiite mosques in Iraq.\n\nMr. Sadr, who commands a powerful and often unruly militia, has instructed his fighters not to resist the latest security plan. At the same time, he has publicly denounced the expanded American presence in Baghdad and demanded that American troops stay out of the neighborhoods he controls.\n\nThe reaction to the raid among much of the elected Shiite leadership was muted, suggesting either that the American account held up in their view or that they were not willing to create a stir that could risk imperiling the new American-Iraqi security plan.\n\nFierce clashes on Tuesday near Falluja, pitting Sunni Arab tribal fighters and the Iraqi police on one side and insurgents from Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia on the other, killed 32 insurgents, 10 tribesmen and 8 police officers, according to officials in the Falluja police department.\n\nThe fighting, in the contested area of Amiriya near Falluja, involved members of the Anbar Salvation Council, a federation of tribes that banded together last September to resist the Sunni jihadists of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.\n\nHamid al-Eesouwi, the leader of one of the tribes, said in a telephone interview that the tribal federation decided to carry out its assault on the insurgents after suicide truck bombers struck in tribal territory south of Falluja on Friday using vehicles laden with chlorine gas and explosives.\n\nA concealed bomb exploded next to an American patrol near the Jadriya Bridge in Baghdad on Tuesday, killing one American soldier, an official at the Interior Ministry said.\n\nThree car bombs in the capital -- near a mosque in the Obaydie neighborhood, in an industrial area of Sheik Omar Street and near the 14th of July Bridge, leading to the Green Zone -- killed at least eight people and wounded at least 28, the ministry official said.\n\nMortar shells landed in the Dora neighborhood of southern Baghdad, killing at least six people and wounding 15, the official said, and 32 bodies were found in various locations around Baghdad. Gunmen assassinated Capt. Hussain Abdullah, an officer in the intelligence service of the Interior Ministry, the official said.\n\nThe body of Taha Yassin Ramadan, Saddam Hussein's vice president, who was hanged before dawn on Tuesday, was flown by American helicopter to an American military base outside Tikrit. Mr. Ramadan's body, wrapped in an Iraqi flag, was buried in the village of Awja near a marble tomb where Mr. Hussein's body was interred after he was hanged in December. Last week the bodies of Mr. Hussein's sons, Uday and Qusay, were unearthed and reburied outside the tomb.\n\nCorrection:  March 23, 2007, Friday  An article on Wednesday about violence in Iraq misspelled the surname of an American general who described a car bombing in which he said insurgents had used two children as decoys to deceive soldiers at a Baghdad checkpoint. He is Michael D. Barbero, not Barbaro."

        "document": "The planned departure for Los Angeles of the British soccer star and tabloid darling David Beckham grabbed headlines and kicked off a fresh round of soccer optimism. Once again, boosters could claim that what the rest of the world calls football would finally hit the big time in the United States -- for a mere $250 million over five years.\n\nCannier observers pointed out the similarity to the multimillion-dollar signing of the legendary Brazilian soccer star Pel\u00e9 by the New York Cosmos three decades ago. That gave the sport a brief jolt in this country but one that quickly faded, followed by the failure of that era's professional league.\n\nThe news of Mr. Beckham's move -- and that of his paparazzi-magnet wife, the former Posh Spice -- overshadowed this week's announcement that Clint Dempsey would be leaving.\n\nWho is Clint Dempsey?\n\nHe is a 23-year-old firebrand midfielder who scored the only goal by an American in last year's World Cup (the Italians scored one on themselves for us) and briefly raised hopes that the United States could advance to the second round. He was the 2006 player of the year for the United States national team, but that hardly makes him a household name.\n\nNaturally, Mr. Dempsey is on his way to Europe -- the English Premier League team Fulham -- where arguably the best professional soccer is played. While Mr. Dempsey has a bright future, Mr. Beckham, at 31, may have his best days behind him. Don't get us wrong, he is still good. But he decided to cross the Atlantic only after losing a step, and his position as captain of the English national team.\n\nBeyond the money and the glamour, Mr. Beckham's story appeals to us because it matches a notion we Americans cherish about ourselves: We are a destination. The best want to come here, play here and live here. We aren't accustomed to sending our children abroad to seek their fortunes the way other countries have, be they Ireland or Mexico.\n\nMr. Beckham has made a sizable splash, but the future of the sport in America probably rests on the Latino immigrants who arrive with a love of the game and pass it on to their children. Until then our homegrown talents will blossom abroad. We are still the most powerful nation in the world and the largest economy, but we aren't the only game in town.\n\nEditorial"

        "document": "They call Australia the lucky country, and there may be no better example of its good fortune than the unexpected windfall Sydney is reaping at the end of these Olympics.\n\nThanks to a steep drop in the value of the Australian dollar relative to the United States dollar, the broadcast rights earmarked to the Sydney Olympic committee have risen in value by about $28 million.\n\n''Australians don't like having a weak dollar because they view exchange rates as a scorecard you get  on your country,'' said Bruce Hockman, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank here. ''But it's great for the Olympic committee because it will help them balance their books.''\n\nAs Sydney closes the books on a generally trouble-free Olympics, the bigger question is, how much of a long-term economic boost will the Games give to the city, and to Australia as a whole?\n\nThe government, citing a study by the consulting firm Arthur Andersen, figures the Olympics will add $3.6 billion to Australia's gross domestic product in the 12 years before and after the Games. It says the money will come mainly from increased tourism, but also from new jobs and consumer spending.\n\nIn the current quarter alone, according to the government, the Games boosted Australia's economic output by 1 percent, through tourism receipts, ticket sales, broadcast rights and sponsorship fees.\n\nThe real bonanza could come later, if Australia can capitalize on the success of the Games to become a top tourist destination. The Australian Tourism Forecasting Council predicts that 1.04 million additional tourists will visit here between 2001 and 2004 because of the aura of the Olympics.\n\nBut skeptics note that Australia is still a very long way from Europe and the United States. Many fewer people than expected came to the Games, largely because they balked at the marathon flight.\n\nNor have the Olympics been a boon for previous host cities, like Barcelona, which were looking to put themselves on the map. In fact, the enduring legacy for most cities has been a nasty hangover.\n\nMontreal took decades to pay off more than $1 billion in debt from the 1976 Games. Barcelona was left with $1.4 billion in debts after 1992. Even Los Angeles and Atlanta, which turned a profit on their Games, gained little in the way of jobs or other long-term economic benefits.\n\nSydney's goal was simply to break even. And it did that, give or take $38 million. But the finances looked parlous for a while.\n\nUnder an agreement between the Sydney Olympic committee and the state of New South Wales, the government invested $1.2 billion to improve roads, railroad links and other infrastructure. It also pledged $259 million for extra police, medical care, and other services during the Games.\n\nThe Olympic committee had a budget of $1.3 billion, which it was supposed to meet through broadcast-rights fees, sponsorships, ticket sales and licensing arrangements. Six months before the Games opened, it ran over budget and the state had to set up a $76 million bailout fund.\n\nSydney Olympic officials said they had drawn half of those funds to pay for the higher-than-expected cost of completing sites. In the scheme of things, they said, a $38 million shortfall was not much.\n\n''People always understood that the Games would cost more than the government projected,'' said Graham Cassidy, a spokesman for the Olympic committee. ''That has been the reality ever since Montreal.''\n\nThe Olympic committee would have had a bigger shortfall but for two things: a last-minute surge in ticket sales, which allowed it to sell 90 percent of its supply, and the crash of the Australian dollar.\n\nThis helped Sydney because its largest single source of revenue -- $633 million in rights fees -- are paid by NBC and other broadcasters in United States dollars. At the time the deals were signed, the Olympic committee calculated they were worth 1.03 billion Australian dollars.\n\nSince then, the Aussie dollar has fallen to a near-record low of 0.54 to the United States dollar. By the magic of foreign exchange, the rights are now valued at about 1.2 billion Australian dollars. Since the broadcasters still owe $300 million, that translates into a $28 million gain.\n\nThe weak currency could also help Australia's tourism efforts. ''The most important thing is that Americans will go home and tell people how cheap Australia is for a vacation,'' Mr. Hockman said.\n\nBeyond the direct benefits, Australia believes the Games will enhance its standing in the global economy. Despite having an educated work force and a remarkably healthy economy, Australia has been somewhat overlooked by investors in developed countries because of its geographic isolation.\n\nThe last two weeks have been a marvelous showcase for Australia's accomplishments in engineering and technology. Whether it is the soaring Olympic stadium, the efficient railroad system or the modern wireless telephone network, Australia is a force to be reckoned with.\n\n''These are the first Games of the new economy,'' said Tim Harcourt, chief economist of the Australian Trade Commission. ''We've shown we're strong in the pool, but we're also strong in other skills.''\n\nA few multinational firms are already recognizing Australia's talents. Cisco Systems, the Internet equipment maker, recently established a Sydney office with 1,000 employees to serve Asian customers in 15 languages.\n\nAustralian firms are also winning recognition abroad. The local company that designed the seating in many of the Olympic arenas is on the short list of candidates to design the seats in Wembley Stadium in London, which is being rebuilt. It may also pick up a lucrative contract for the Athens Games.\n\nMany Olympic host cities -- even successful ones -- have struggled to make use of the vast stadiums and other facilities that remain after the Olympic torch is extinguished. That is especially true in Sydney, which built more sites, on a grander scale, than most of its predecessors.\n\nWith the completion of the Olympic stadium in 1999, Sydney became one of the few cities of its size with three huge stadiums. The Olympic Park has nine other major facilities -- some outdoor, some domed.\n\nCassidy said the park would pay for itself by revitalizing the geographic heart of Sydney. The site on which the world's greatest athletes competed over the last two weeks had been a wasteland of slaughterhouses, landfills and toxic-waste dumps before the Olympic building program began.\n\nSydney will use the Olympic stadium for rugby matches, and as a likely home for a second Australian-rules football team. It also plans to rent the tennis courts and other facilities for private use.\n\nStill, Mr. Hockman said it was hard to imagine how Sydney, with a population of four million, could sponsor enough sporting events or generate enough traffic to fill all these facilities regularly.\n\n''That's a big issue, but it's not necessarily a problem for the government, because most of the buildings are privately owned,'' he said.\n\nSYDNEY 2000"

Her earlier attempts to check reports of rights violations were rebuffed, prompting concerns that Russia was trying to avoid scrutiny in advance of its presidential election.\n\nMrs. Robinson, in her opening statement today to the commission, said she planned to report back shortly after returning from her visit.

        "document": "When the Bush administration unveils its State Department budget for 2004 on Monday, it will call for the largest increase in foreign assistance in two decades. But more significantly, many experts say, it will introduce a new program that would begin overhauling the way America distributes aid to the poorest countries.\n\nFar more than in traditional aid programs, the new program, known as the Millennium Challenge Account, will demand that recipient states be accountable for the American tax dollars they spend.\n\nExperts say the plan, which would operate in tandem with existing aid programs, reflects an ambitious effort by President Bush to place a Republican stamp on foreign aid, much as he has tried to do with federal education programs.\n\nIn particular, the plan attempts to answer the longstanding conservative complaint that foreign aid has become global welfare: abused by corrupt regimes, squandered on ineffective projects and laxly monitored by liberal bureaucrats.\n\n''The Millennium Challenge Account could be the leading wedge of change in the way we do foreign aid,'' said Nancy Birdsall, president of the Center for Global Development, a poverty research group based in Washington. ''It is an effort to make the business of aid much more businesslike.''\n\nUnder the plan, the administration would give more aid to a smaller number of countries that can pass a rigorous set of ''performance'' criteria. To be eligible, countries would have to demonstrate a desire and ability to control corruption, defend political rights, invest in education and health care and promote free trade, among other things.\n\nRecipients would sign multiyear ''contracts'' that could be canceled if the countries failed to show that they were improving the quality of life for their people and making political and economic reforms. The recipients would also be subject to financial audits, much like companies that get government business.\n\nThe program would be overseen by a government corporation of about 125 employees that would report to an executive board representing the Office of Management and Budget and the State and Treasury departments. Currently, most aid programs are administered by the United States Agency for International Development, a State Department unit widely reviled by Republicans as bureaucratic and inefficient.\n\nThe new plan, along with proposals by President Bush to increase spending to fight AIDS and reduce hunger overseas, would raise foreign assistance to more than $18 billion in the 2004 fiscal year, an increase of more than $2 billion, administration officials said. That would reverse a steady decline since the mid-1980's that has reduced foreign aid, based on 2002 dollars, to pre-World War II levels, experts said.\n\nComing at a time when the Bush administration has been criticized overseas for saber rattling against Iraq, the new programs could help show that the United States does not base its diplomacy entirely on military power, experts said.\n\n''There's no question this came out of a process after Sept. 11 in which President Bush and his advisers decided they needed to take some steps to exploit what can be called the soft power of the United States,'' Ms. Birdsall said.\n\nBut the plan has also stirred concerns among some aid groups that Millennium Challenge will drain money from other State Department programs, including one intended to encourage democratic reforms in Middle Eastern countries. Few, if any, Middle Eastern countries will be eligible for Millennium Challenge money because of corruption, high income levels or lack of democratic rights, experts and administration officials said.\n\nAid groups have questioned the need for creating a new bureaucracy, which they say might lack expertise and be subject to political pressures from the White House.\n\n''This has great potential for reform,'' said Mary E. McClymont, president and chief executive of InterAction, an umbrella organization for 160 aid groups. ''But we hope the president will hold to his promise to make sure this is used to fight poverty. It should not become a diplomatic slush fund.''\n\nIn general, however, the plan has won broad support, for one major reason: After watching Republicans slash at foreign aid budgets for many years, aid groups are relieved to see a conservative president embrace foreign aid with his own program. One result, they say, could be a bipartisan consensus behind foreign assistance for the first time since the cold war.\n\n''The big story is, the Bush administration has surprised us all and turned out to be a big promoter of aid, at least in rhetoric,'' said Scott B. Lasensky, an expert in foreign aid at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''They've once believed foreign aid was money down a rat hole.''\n\nSenator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, said the amount proposed by Mr. Bush was still ''woefully inadequate.'' But he called the plan ''a constructive step because it targets additional aid to counties that are committed to ending corruption, reforming their economies and building democracy.''\n\nThe president's budget will call for allocating $1.3 billion to Millennium Challenge in 2004, $2.6 billion in 2005 and $5 billion annually after that. Mr. Bush had pledged to spend $1.6 billion on the plan in 2004, but administration officials said they decided the program could not spend that much money in its first year. Officials say they do not intend to cut other foreign aid programs in 2004.\n\nUnder the administration's proposed criteria, fewer than a dozen countries would be eligible for money in 2004, officials said. A country would need to show per capita annual income below $1,435 and an ability to control corruption before being considered. Countries with higher income levels would be allowed to compete in 2005.\n\nApplicants would have to perform well in as many as 16 categories, including civil liberties and political rights, immunization rates and primary education spending, credit ratings and deficit reduction.\n\nAmong the countries considered likely candidates for aid in the first year are Uganda, Mongolia, Bangladesh, Bolivia and Indonesia, administration officials and aid experts said.\n\nBecause the list is small, recipients would get much more than the typical foreign aid grant of today, which is about $50 million a year, a senior administration official said.\n\nAlthough Republicans in Congress who have opposed foreign aid are likely to support the president's proposal, they may try to trim it to control the widening deficit.\n\n''The challenge we'll have is with a Congress that is grappling with deficits,'' said Sam Stratman, spokesman for Representative Henry J. Hyde, an Illinois Republican who is chairman of the House International Relations Committee and a supporter of the aid program. ''The president is going to have to make the case that this kind of foreign assistance enhances American security.''"

        "document": "Down and almost out of her 1999 French Open final, Steffi Graf narrowed her eyes, squared her shoulders, stalked to her changeover chair at the tennis tournament and gave herself a terse pep talk.\n\n''This is the last time you'll sit in this chair, so you better make her earn it,'' the German star told herself that Saturday in early June.\n\nWithin minutes, she reignited her heavy, powerful strokes and reduced Martina Hingis, her top-ranked opponent, who had once said Graf was past her prime, to a sobbing runner-up.\n\nBut yesterday, tennis's most dominating player in the late 80's and early 90's said she had lost what had been one of her most feared weapons: an unflagging will to excel.\n\nFrom her home in Heidelberg, Germany, the 30-year-old player who had spent more time at No. 1 than any other man or woman in tennis, announced that her career was over, effective immediately.\n\n''I felt right after Paris and Wimbledon that the motivation wasn't what it was in the past,'' Graf said, referring to two of the sport's biggest events.\n\nMoney was not an issue. She has earned $21.8 million in prize money, more than any other female athlete in any sport, and earned millions more in endorsements in her native Germany.\n\n''I thought long and hard after Wimbledon about where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do with my tennis,'' Graf said, ''and for the first time in my career, I didn't feel like going to a tournament.''\n\nWith her decision, Graf joined a Hall of Fame roster of 1999 retirees that includes Michael Jordan in basketball, John Elway in football and Wayne Gretzky in hockey.\n\nGraf had been characteristically secretive about her retirement plans, though she had said that her appearances in the French Open and Wimbledon finals this year would be her last there. Graf said she had no regrets about the timing of her decision, even though she is still ranked third in the world.\n\n''I've done everything I wanted to do in tennis,'' she said. ''I haven't had one second thought.\n\n''I just feel the time is right to move on.''\n\nGraf is only the third woman besides Maureen Connolly (1953) and Margaret Court (1970) to accomplish a Grand Slam by winning the sport's four crown jewels, the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the United States Open, in a calendar year, in 1988. Later that year she won the gold medal at the Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nA partial list of Graf's other accomplishments are equally remarkable:\n\n*She is the only player, male or female, to win all four Grand Slam events four times.\n\n*In 1987, she reached the final of every event she played, which no other Open era player has done.\n\n*She assumed the No. 1 ranking for the first time on Aug. 17, 1987, and her 186 consecutive weeks at the top remain unmatched by any player, male or female.\n\n*In all, Graf accumulated a record 377 weeks at No. 1 and finished more seasons at the top than any other player.\n\nBut records and rankings meant little to Graf.\n\nShe said she would not pursue Martina Navratilova's record nine Wimbledon titles, and after collecting her 22d Grand Slam crown in Paris this June, Graf denied that the proximity to Court's career record of 24 would inspire her to prolong her career. Graf's motivational forces were internal, not external, and she never longed for the sort of rivalry shared by Navratilova and Chris Evert because her main opponent was always herself.\n\nPerfection was Graf's goal in every match, and her consistent pursuit of perfection left her with a 902-115 won-lost record and a winning percentage of .887, second only to Evert's .900.\n\nThe introverted Graf, wary of trying to combine actual competition with the distracting hoopla of a farewell tour the way her predecessors Evert and Navratilova had, preferred to say that she had no plan to quit and would compete until she stopped enjoying the game.\n\nBut Graf, renowned for being a self-starter, notorious for her marathon practice sessions and incessant off-court training regimen, realized that she had lost her resolve after losing in the Wimbledon final and preparing for the summer hardcourt season in preparation for the Open.\n\n''The motivation to perform at the highest level was no longer there, and the fun had gone out of practicing and training,'' said Graf, whose game was based on a trend-setting powerful forehand and quick feet, with a wicked slice backhand and a strong serve added for measure.\n\nGraf later said that her victory at Roland Garros against the top-ranked Hingis, her only title this year and her first Grand Slam title since she won the 1996 United States Open, was all the more special because it happened unexpectedly. Sidelined by leg and back problems this spring, Graf had entered the French Open merely to ready herself for Wimbledon, her favorite tournament. Less than a month later, and despite what she described by ''running on fumes,'' she reached the Wimbledon final, only to lose to Lindsay Davenport, who by then was the new No. 1.\n\nGraf did not trace her retirement to the wear and tear of cumulative injuries. A hamstring pull caused her to abandon what turned out to be the last match of her career, a second-round loss against Amy Frazier last week in San Diego.\n\nWhat Graf had experienced lately, said her longtime coach, Heinz Gunthardt, were second thoughts not about retiring but about continuing to play. When Graf first mentioned retirement two years ago during a lengthy recuperation from knee surgery, Gunthardt cautioned her about leaving the game too soon. This year he did not dissuade her.\n\n''I felt she had earned the privilege to quit any time she likes; after all, what was there that she hadn't already accomplished at least once,'' Gunthardt said. ''The French was like a fairy tale ending, and Wimbledon came close, but even during Wimbledon she was running on empty a little bit. She didn't enjoy it as much as she'd expected she would, and she was completely empty afterward. Steffi was never one to play for records or titles. She played for love of the game, and when you take that away, what's there?''\n\nGraf broke into the game in 1982 at 13, the youngest player to turn professional. By her own measure, she was not an instant success. Skinny and lacking in strategy, it took the gangly teen-ager more than three years to win the first of her 107 WTA titles. But the first, a 6-4, 7-5 victory against Evert at Hilton Head in 1986, was a harbinger of bigger upsets soon to come. Later that year, Graf defeated the top-ranked Navratilova in the Berlin final, and in 1987, Graf captured her inaugural Grand Slam championship with a victory over Navratilova at the French Open.\n\nGraf was, according to Evert and Navratilova, emblematic of a new generation of power player: insulated by an entourage, largely uninterested in the game's history, obsessed with excellence, satisfied by nothing less than a championship.\n\nShe was also dogged by off-the-court troubles. In 1993, a man claiming to be a Graf fan stabbed Monica Seles, the woman who had supplanted her at No. 1, during a tournament in Germany. Seles's subsequent two-year absence from the game enabled Graf to dominate again. Graf was also initially coached by her father, Peter, whose skirmishes with German tax authorities over his misrepresentation of her more than $20 million in prize money eventually led to a jail term of about two years.\n\nIn Germany, a tennis-hungry nation stung also by the retirement of Boris Becker, the loss of Graf has devastating implications.\n\n''Without her, I'm not very optimistic about the future of women's tennis in Germany,'' Karl Weber, head of the German Tennis Federation, said.\n\nBut Phil de Picciotto, president of Graf's United States management firm, Advantage International, specified that Graf's plans include consulting work with the German Fed Cup team. Graf also will embark on a six-month exhibition tour in December that opens in South Africa.\n\n''She was always so disciplined in her tennis that everything else was a distanced priority,'' he said. ''I think she's relieved and calm that she can finally explore some of the other sides of her personality.''\n\nTENNIS"

        "document": "For the first time since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, a United States Olympic Committee task force will visit New York on Sunday and Monday to evaluate its worthiness to be America's designated host city competing for the 2012 Summer Games.\n\nThe Olympic plan laid out by NYC2012 for the task force's visit last summer, which advanced New York into a pool of four candidate cities, has not changed much.\n\nBut the city's image has.\n\n''We don't want any sympathy for that,'' said Daniel L. Doctoroff, who founded NYC2012, a nonprofit group that is lobbying for the Games, and who is now the city's deputy mayor for economic development.\n\nAfter Sept. 11, he said, ''The rest of the country saw in New York the true face of the city: the compassion, the courage and the resilience.''\n\nThe premise of the Olympic bid is that New York's spirit and ethnic diversity, as well as its ability to handle security for enormous events, embody Olympic ideals.\n\nNew York's rivals -- San Francisco, Houston and Washington-Baltimore -- offer their own variations of the patriotic-Olympic sentiments.\n\nThe four cities are competing to be among the two chosen by the U.S.O.C. task force in September. Then, in November, the full Olympic Committee board will select the city it will present to the International Olympic Committee; the I.O.C. will make a final choice in 2005.\n\nThe task force will tour some athletic sites and the location of the proposed Olympic Village in Long Island City on Sunday. But the critical part of the visit will be a planned five-hour session at City Hall on Monday, in which the task force will pose questions to a group that will include NYC2012 officials, some Olympians and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly.\n\n''We'll get grilled,'' Doctoroff said.\n\nThe group will also show the U.S.O.C. panel two new videos and a scale model of the Olympic Village, which would be converted into housing after the Olympics.\n\nIn conjunction with the task force's visit, NYC2012 is draping several prominent buildings -- among them Madison Square Garden, the AOL Time Warner headquarters building that is under construction at Columbus Circle and the Pace University building opposite City Hall -- with 42-foot banners proclaiming, ''We've been training for this forever.'' Newspapers will be inserted over the weekend with posters featuring a map of the 26 sites that would be reached by ferry or rail.\n\nAlthough the fundamentals of NYC2012's athletic, housing, transportation, finance and security plans have not been changed, more detail has been added. The group has a more detailed environmental impact plan for the two existing lakes at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park; these would be merged into one for canoeing and rowing.\n\nMeanwhile, consultants have been hired by city or state agencies to study urban design and zoning of the far West Side of Manhattan, where the NYC2012 plan envisions extending the No. 7 subway line.\n\nTwo other studies are under way to analyze financing for the subway extension and the building of platforms over the Long Island Rail Road storage yards, upon which an extension of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center would be built. It would be convertible into a stadium for the Jets, and also for the Olympics.\n\nNYC2012 has not moved the proposed locations of any sports, as San Francisco and Washington have done to provide tighter clusters of sites to ease athlete and spectator movement.\n\nSan Francisco shifted some events from Sacramento, while Washington moved some sports from George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and others from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. The New York and Houston groups deemed their plans compact enough.\n\nNYC2012 expects to spend about $13 million to mount its bid and has raised $11 million, Jay L. Kriegel, the group's executive director, said. ''We've been very frugal, very careful,'' he said, adding that additional fund-raising would be necessary if New York receives the U.S.O.C.'s designation.\n\nOLYMPICS"

        "document": "With only three days left until the deadline for a Northern Ireland peace settlement, the American former Senator George J. Mitchell, chairman of the talks, gave Protestant and Roman Catholic negotiators early today a set of urgent compromise proposals for ending the province's sectarian warfare.\n\nThe details of the proposals were not made public and were distributed only to leaders of the eight northern political parties at the talks in the Stormont government complex here.\n\nBut the disputed and complicated issues they cover are widely known by the negotiators, who face a deadline of Thursday to come to an agreement. The deadline was set by Mr. Mitchell and the Irish Republic and British Governments, sponsors of the talks.\n\nMr. Mitchell said that his 65 pages of proposals would give the negotiators a comphrensive look at the ''many problems'' that persisted, and that he had suggested compromises to some of them. And he added at an early morning news conference that ''we are close to bringing this to a successful conclusion.''\n\nHe said his role in the peace effort would end on Thursday, after three years. ''I hope to be home for Easter,'' he said.\n\nThe proposals were based on positions taken by the northern political parties in recent days. They deal with new political bodies that would drastically change the politics of the province, and with Catholic complaints that they have been oppressed by the Protestant-dominated police and politicians.\n\nThe province, which has been ruled directly from London since 1972, has 900,000 Protestants and 650,000 Catholics. Most Protestants want an agreement that will keep Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom; most Catholics want the Irish Republic to have more influence in the north.\n\nSince the violence in the province, involving Catholic and Protestant guerrillas and the British Army, stepped up in 1969, more than 3,200 people have been killed.\n\nEssentially the proposals are an urgent attempt to achieve compromise in the disputes between the Catholic negotiators of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army, and of the mainstream Social Democratic Labor Party, on one side, and the Protestant Ulster Unionist Party on the other.\n\nThe Catholics want more political power in Northern Ireland and increased influence for the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic in the affairs of this British province.\n\nThe most serious disputes are over three issues: the power and functions of a new Northern Ireland Assembly; the authority and function of a new cross-border North-South Council, and the Irish constitutional claim to sovereignty in Northern Ireland.\n\nCatholics want the new Assembly to be a powerful legislative body in which, through a system of weighted voting, the Protestant majority could not run roughshod over the Catholic minority. Protestants want a weaker, consultative body.\n\nThe Catholics want the North-South Council to have the power to make decisions that would be binding on both sides of the border in areas like tourism, agriculture and fisheries. Protestants say such a council would be a Trojan horse that northern Catholics and the Irish Government would use for the eventual creation of a united Ireland, free of British control and run from Dublin.\n\nPrime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland says Ireland's constitutional claim to sovereignty to Northern Ireland will be toned down. Protestants say they want to see the specifics of the change before they consider compromising on other issues."

Ross, the chief executive of Warner Communications, was desperate to retain the music executive Nesuhi Ertegun in 1971, stock options and corporate largess were not on the table.\n\n''Steve said to Nesuhi, 'If you please stay, I'll promise whatever you fancy,' '' Ahmet Ertegun, Nesuhi's younger brother, said in a telephone interview. ''My brother was an avid soccer fan since he was a small child and half-joking said he would like to have a professional soccer team.''\n\nThe team became the Cosmos. The rest became history.\n\nNesuhi Ertegun, who died in 1989, and Ross, who died in 1992, will be inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in Oneonta, N.Y., on Saturday along with Ahmet Ertegun and 13 other officials and players from the North American Soccer League.\n\nAhmet Ertegun co-founded Atlantic Records in the late 1940's and Nesuhi joined the label in 1956; both went on to storied careers in the music industry. They may be the only two people who will ever be members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the soccer hall.\n\nIt was the Erteguns, the sons of a Turkish ambassador to the United States, who made the Cosmos cosmopolitan before globalization. The team modeled itself after the great European clubs like Real Madrid and became a magnet for some of the world's best players.\n\n''We brought in some great players,'' Ertegun said. ''At one point Steve Ross asked, 'Who's the best player in the world?' That's when we went and got Pel\u00e9. It was our intention to get as many players from as many different countries to attract the crowds. I went to Barcelona to talk to Johan Cruyff. Now, I've dealt with some pretty difficult people, like the manager of Led Zeppelin and Mick Jagger, but Cruyff was perhaps the most difficult.''\n\nAfter the demise of the Cosmos and the N.A.S.L., Ertegun was a member of the organizing committee for the 1994 World Cup in the United States.\n\n''I still like to believe that the Cosmos were partly responsible for creating interest in the game here; we planted the seed,'' Ertegun said. ''But I think perhaps the most gratifying thing for me has been the emergence of the women's soccer team.

        "document": "Despite new clues suggesting that the bombing of the destroyer Cole may have involved more than the two men who died in the blast, American officials cautioned today against concluding that they were close to identifying the group responsible or to retaliating militarily.\n\nEleven days after the attack that killed 17 sailors and wounded 39, Yemeni officials working with the Americans in the investigation said they had found three more safe houses, bringing the total discovered so far to five. Yemeni security sources also said that a group of officials in Lahej, a town about 25  miles north, had been detained for allegedly allowing offices there to issue identity documents with assumed names that were used in the conspiracy.\n\nOne of those documents was an identity card thought to have belonged to one of the two men who pulled a skiff alongside the Cole in Aden harbor and detonated enough explosives to blow a hole 40 feet in diameter in the vessel's port side. In a report citing Yemeni security sources close to the investigation, the Associated Press said today that the document was issued in the name of Abdullah Ahmed Khaled al-Musawah, but the American and Yemeni officials refused to confirm the name or to say that the name represented a significant breakthrough.\n\nThe identity card was part of a haul of evidence uncovered by the Yemenis earlier last week when a 12-year-old Yemeni boy led them to an abandoned vehicle and a boat trailer left beside a remote boat ramp about six miles from the harbor mooring point where the Cole was attacked. The boy also led them to the first two safe houses, in the neighborhoods of Little Aden and Medinat Ash Shab. Yemeni officials, who reported today that they had uncovered the additional safe houses, would only say they  were in or near Aden.\n\nWhen the earlier discoveries were made known, six days after the bombing, American officials implied that the trail followed by F.B.I. agents, who have accompanied Yemeni investigators at every stage of the probe, had gone cold after it was established that an important document found in one of the houses, a driver's license was issued in a false name. The trail led, among other places, to Hadhramaut, a remote province in eastern Yemen named on the license as the holder's place of origin.\n\nThis left them with a photograph of a man on the license, said to have been in his 30's or early 40's, who investigators believe may have been ''the bearded man with spectacles'' identified by the Yemeni boy as having drawn up in the vehicle on the morning of the Cole attack.\n\nToday, a Yemeni official confirmed that the vehicle found near the boat ramp was a Nissan with four-wheel drive, a kind widely used in this country of rocky deserts and rugged mountain passes. Officials in Washington have said the boat was 20 to 26 feet long and white, and that shards found on the Cole, now being examined along with other evidence at F.B.I. laboratories in Washington, indicated that it was made of fiberglass. A tank apparently used to test the boat's outboard motor was found at one of the safe houses\n\nBarbara K. Bodine, the American ambassador to Yemen, said on Saturday that the investigation was ''expanding,'' to the point that American officials were confident that they would break the case. But after the  report today about a name on the driver's license, American officials here tried to discourage speculation that they were closing in on suspects. They said their ''prime suspect'' was  ''the broad jihadist network'' -- the  array of Islamic militant groups from east Asia to the Middle East that have declared a ''holy war,'' or jihad in Arabic, against the United States.\n\nAt a briefing, the officials insisted that they were far away from being able to recommend possible targets for a retaliatory American military strike of the kind hinted at by President Clinton, who vowed after the Cole attack that those responsible would be held ''accountable'' and allowed ''no safe harbor.'' After the terrorist bombings of two American embassies in east Africa in August, 1998, Mr. Clinton ordered Navy cruise missile strikes on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan, saying that an American investigation had identified Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Arabian exile and Islamic militant living in Afghanistan as the prime figure in the attacks.\n\nMr. bin Laden, who has a $5 million American reward on his head, recently issued warnings of fresh attacks on American targets through a videotape delivered to an Arab-language satellite television channel in Qatar. His name has frequently entered into the Cole investigation, especially after President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen disclosed that the fake driver's license named Hadhramaut, the ancestral home of Mr. bin Laden's family, which moved to Saudi Arabia in the 1950's.\n\nAmerican officials have insisted from the outset of the Cole investigation that their priority in making public statements would be to avoid anything that would ''chill leads.'' This has suggested that they will have a strong incentive to avoid giving out information that would tip off potential targets of a military strike, as appears to have happened in 1998, when Mr. bin Laden fled one of his training camps in Afghanistan shortly before the missiles struck.\n\nBut today they insisted that there was nothing yet to justify speculation that an attack might be imminent. They acknowledged that Mr. bin Laden's recent marriage in the Afghan city of Kandahar to a Yemeni woman, possibly one from Hadhramaut, could indicate he wanted to strengthen contacts with Yemen ahead of a possible move from Afghanistan, but insisted that they were not yet focusing on any individual, group or country as responsible for the Cole attack.\n\n''Even if you were considering a military response at this point, we have no idea where,'' one official said. ''Do we go to Afghanistan, Pakistan -- that's way down the line.''"

        "document": "Between 20,000 and 30,000 allied troops from more than a dozen nations will begin arriving in Iraq in mid-August to replace some of the American forces leading the military occupation there, Pentagon officials said today.\n\nThe international forces -- from countries including Italy, Spain, Ukraine and Honduras -- would join divisions led by Britain, Poland and perhaps another country, possibly India, and assume responsibilities for parts of central and southern Iraq.\n\nHow many American troops will remain in Iraq depends largely on the security situation there and how many other nations ultimately send forces, officials said. There are now about 146,000 American troops in Iraq, just 5,000 fewer than at the peak of the war. About 12,000 troops from Britain and seven other countries are also on the ground.\n\nTestifying before the House Armed Services Committee today, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz and Gen. Peter Pace, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the Pentagon was aggressively recruiting dozens of countries to contribute forces for peacekeeping and reconstruction duties.\n\n''We have about 20,000 additional coalition troops that have been volunteered by countries to go to theater within the next 60 to 90 days,'' General Pace said. He said discussions were under way with another unidentified country to provide 10,000 troops.\n\nBut both officials acknowledged that prodding other nations to sign up has been difficult, even after a United Nations resolution last month cleared the way for other countries to begin contributing.\n\nJust six weeks ago, in fact, administration officials had thought the United States could reduce the number of American forces to about 30,000 troops by this fall. But guerrilla-style attacks from remnants of Saddam Hussein's military, security forces and Baath Party loyalists appear to have dashed those goals.\n\nThroughout today's hearing, Democrats and Republicans chided the defense officials for not doing enough to enlist more allies to help shoulder the burden in Iraq, where the postwar environment is still so dangerous that roughly one American a day has died since President Bush declared on May 1 that major combat operations were over.\n\n''Occupation takes a lot of folks, probably takes a lot more folks than winning the war,'' said Representative Duncan Hunter, a California Republican who heads the panel.\n\nRepresentative Ike Skelton of Missouri, the committee's senior Democrat, added, ''Given the challenges we are facing, we need our allies and their troops more than ever.''\n\nThe Bush administration wants more allied forces for several reasons. The Pentagon wants to put a more international face on an American-dominated occupation. More international troops would cut the expense of an operation that lawmakers said was costing $3 billion a month. Mr. Wolfowitz said the Pentagon would probably have to ask Congress to approve another supplemental spending request to pay for the costs of military operations in Iraq.\n\nBut perhaps most important, at least for domestic political reasons, bringing in more allied forces would allow most of the First Marine Division and the Army's Third Infantry Division, some of whose troops have been deployed overseas for more than a year, to return home.\n\nMr. Wolfowitz said Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had asked Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the commander of American forces in Iraq, to recommend a rotation policy for the two units by the end of June.\n\nThe Pentagon is looking for other ways to lessen the burden on its troops in Iraq. Mr. Wolfowitz repeatedly asked lawmakers today for authority to spend $200 million to train and equip additional Iraqi police forces who would take over duties now performed by Army troops.\n\nGeneral Pace said Iraq needed about 65,000 police officers, but American officials have been able to recruit and train only 20,000 so far.\n\nUnder the Pentagon's current plans, there would be two or three divisions of allied forces, each made up of 10,000 to 14,000 troops. Britain would lead one division, which would also include troops from countries like Denmark and the Netherlands.\n\nThe allied forces would be a mix of combat troops and reconstruction specialists. The 380 Danish troops, for example, would include a light reconnaissance squadron, a civil affairs unit, mine-clearing experts and special operations forces.\n\nPoland has committed 2,300 troops to its division, which Mr. Wolfowitz said today would also include forces from Ukraine, Spain, Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nPentagon officials are negotiating with several other countries, including some that did not support the war. Defense officials have set aside their anger at Turkey for refusing to allow American forces to enter northern Iraq through Turkish territory during the war, to discuss Ankara's offers of reconstruction support.\n\nAdministration officials met recently with the Turkish foreign ministry's second-ranking official, who offered relief aid and other assistance, as well as 1,200 to 1,800 troops. ''Turkey is eager now to assist us in the reconstruction of Iraq,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said. ''That's just one example of a country that has begun to move in our direction.''\n\nAssistant Secretary of Defense Peter W. Rodman recently visited New Delhi to discuss troop commitments with Indian officials. A cabinet committee has yet to decide how to proceed, and the Indian government has said it will consult other political parties before deciding.\n\nAFTER THE WAR: PEACEKEEPING"

        "document": "Residents of British Columbia will receive a big cut in their income taxes on New Year's Day, their second in six months. But far from winning applause, the province's governing Liberal Party is experiencing a drop in public support.\n\nTax cuts were a major promise in the campaign that brought the Liberals to office in the province in a landslide election win last May. The Liberals, led by Gordon Campbell, a former secondary school teacher, real-estate executive and three-term mayor of Vancouver, won all but two of the 79 seats in the western province's legislative assembly. They defeated the left-leaning New Democrats, whose 10 years in office were marked by a growing public role in the economy and numerous tales of economic mismanagement.\n\nWith the Jan. 1 reductions, personal income tax rates for provincial taxes -- which constitute a much larger share of overall taxes for Canadians than state taxes do for Americans -- will have been chopped by an average of 25 percent, turning British Columbia from one of Canada's most heavily taxed provinces to one with some of the lowest tax rates.\n\nThe problem for the new government is that the cuts have coincided with an economic downturn. Rather than reverse the tax cuts, the Liberals have cut government spending.\n\nThe Liberals ''promised more than they could deliver,'' said Philip Resnick, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.\n\nThe forestry industry, which contributes about one-fifth of the province's gross domestic product and employs about 14 percent of the workers, has been hit by weakening demand and by hefty American anti-dumping tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber. Falling commodity prices have hit mines and oil and gas producers.\n\nIn addition, fewer American tourists are visiting British Columbia since the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nFalling tax revenues and heavier demand for social services have turned a budget surplus of 1.3 billion Canadian dollars, about $815 million, in the fiscal year that ended on March 31 into a large deficit.\n\nA government-appointed panel concluded in July that ''unless government makes some fundamental changes, there will be a persistent excess of spending over available revenues, which represents a serious threat to the financial health of the province.''\n\nThe government plans to reduce the provincial civil service by 28 percent, or 9,800 jobs, including 4,800 layoffs.\n\nA three-year spending freeze has been imposed on health care and education, the two biggest items in the province's budget. Benefits under the government-financed drug plan are being tightened.\n\nGary Collins, British Columbia's finance minister, contends that the tax cuts will actually help the situation. ''By fueling consumer spending and business investment, they will help to restore our province's economic leadership position,'' he said.\n\nBut many British Columbians disagree. A poll conducted by Ipsos-Reid Canada in mid-December indicated that the Liberals' approval rating has dropped to 49 percent, from 71 percent just three months earlier.\n\nWhat concerns many British Columbians equally is a sense that the province is returning to a long tradition of political polarization.\n\nThe Liberals ''are governing as if there's no need to continue to dialogue,'' said Norman J. Ruff, political science professor at the University of Victoria, in the provincial capital."

        "document": "With Lothar Matthaus playing in Major League Soccer for the first time in six weeks because of a slipped disk, the MetroStars ended a two-game losing streak with a 2-1 overtime victory over the New England Revolution tonight at soaked Giants Stadium before a crowd announced at 12,688.\n\nAdolfo Valencia scored both goals for the MetroStars (14-9-2), including the so-called golden goal three minutes into the overtime. Valencia got his winner with a powerful header from 6 yards after a corner kick on the right by Clint Mathis. Mathis, who had a sprained right ankle, was used as a substitute for the first time this season, entering the game in the 55th minute.\n\n''It was important for me to play when I'm really fit; it's nice to see that the team can win with me,'' Matthaus said with a smile. ''Now, I can concentrate on the MetroStars and nothing else.''\n\nCoach Octavio Zambrano was impressed with the way his MetroStars rallied after falling behind by a goal with three minutes left in regulation.\n\n''I'm extremely proud of the guys,'' he said. ''They pulled through and they were rewarded at the end.''\n\nMatthaus started the play that led to Valencia's first goal, which tied the score with two minutes left in regulation and one minute after New England's Wolde Harris had opened the scoring. Matthaus gave the ball to Mathis for the pass to Valencia, who beat Jurgen Sommer with a low shot from close range for his team-leading 12th goal of the season.\n\nThe victory, the MetroStars' third of the season over New England, strengthened their position atop the Eastern Division, where they have an 11-point lead over the second-place Revolution (9-11-6).\n\nThe MetroStars looked headed for defeat when Harris scored for the fifth consecutive game. Taking a pass from Mauricio Wright after a corner kick by John Harkes, Harris beat Mike Ammann from 10 yards. But Matthaus rallied the MetroStars with his pass to Mathis.\n\nIt was another physical battle between the rivals, who committed 92 fouls in two previous games. This time there were 34 fouls and an ejection, the MetroStars' Steve Shak, for his second violent play in the game.\n\nThe MetroStars played without midfielders Tab Ramos and Roy Myers because of a one-game suspension and duty with the Costa Rican national team, respectively. Without them, the MetroStars seemed to bypass the midfield by having Matt haus playing long passes to the forwards from his defensive position.\n\nWith a slick field and the ball skidding, a number of Matthaus's long passes were slightly off target. As a result, there was little coordination around the penalty area, rarely putting any serious pressure on Sommer, the Revolution's goalkeeper.\n\nThe MetroStars' first genuine chance came in the 52nd minute when Alex Comas entered the penalty area with authority on the right and passed to Mark Chung about 4 yards from the goal. The pass was to his right foot, however, and the shot by the left-footed Chung was blocked. He had another good chance in the 78th minute, but Sommer tipped his left-footed shot over the crossbar.\n\nSOCCER"

        "document": "The MetroStars are in negotiations with Saudi Arabia's federation over Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, who is expected to leave the team with a year left on his contract to coach the Saudis in the World Cup in France this summer.\n\n''It hasn't been finalized that he is leaving,'' Charlie Stillitano, the vice president and general manager of the MetroStars, said yesterday, ''but it's very close, and as far as I'm concerned it's all counterproductive now.''\n\nStillitano is a frustrated man because Parreira indicated two months ago that he was staying with the MetroStars. As a result, Stillitano believes he missed an opportunity to hire Bob Bradley, an assistant with D.C. United and one of the original candidates for the head job with the MetroStars. Instead, Bradley was hired in October as the head coach of the expansion Chicago Fire.\n\nBut there are several other candidates for the MetroStars job. Stillitano has signed Alfonso Mondelo to join the coaching staff. Mondelo has had plenty of success as the coach of the Long Island Roughriders in the A-League, which is a step below Major League Soccer, and he is qualified to be the head coach.\n\nRalph Perez, the assistant to Parreira last year, and to Carlos Queiroz and Eddie Firmani in the MetroStars' first year, is also a head coaching candidate, but Stillitano may want to pursue a higher-profile coach.\n\nOfficials said that Stillitano was asking for about $2 million from the Saudis as compensation for losing Parreira, who led Brazil to its World Cup triumph in 1994.\n\nUnless Bora Milutinovic gets a job to coach in the World Cup in France, Parreira, a Brazilian, will be the only man to coach four different countries in the World Cup finals. He coached Kuwait in the 1982 tournament in Spain and the United Arab Emirates in the 1990 World Cup in Italy before coaching Brazil in 1994.\n\n''I'm not going to stand in Carlos's way,'' Stillitano said yesterday, ''but I want compensation for breaking his contract. I like the man a lot. He has done plenty to prepare us for next season in terms of identifying the kind of players we can use from within the league and overseas.''\n\nWORLD CUP\n\nUnited States Coach Steve Sampson and General Manager Tom King have inspected potential training sites in the three cities, Paris, Lyons and Nantes, where the Americans will play in the first round in France next summer. The Americans will depart for France on June 6, arriving in Lyons the next day. They will play Germany in Paris on June 15, Iran in Lyons on June 21 and Yugoslavia in Nantes on June 25.\n\nSampson is expected to call about 30 players into the team's training camp in Orlando, Fla., on Jan. 5. The team will train at Orlando's Seminole County Training Center through Jan. 27 and is expected to arrive in Berkeley, Calif., for Gold Cup on Jan. 28.\n\nChina, North Korea and Japan became the first three countries to qualify for the 1999 Women's World Cup in the United States, following the Asian Cup that ended Sunday in China.\n\nThe Americans, who qualify automatically as the host nation, split a two-game series with Brazil. After rallying for a 2-1 victory on Thursday, the Americans dropped a 1-0 decision to Brazil in Sao Paulo on Sunday. It was the first loss in eight games against Brazil for the Americans, who were held scoreless for the first time since a 0-0 tie with China in the 1996 Olympics.\n\nARGENTINA\n\nRiver Plate moved within a point of winning its third consecutive title Sunday, beating Colon by 2-1 despite the ejections of two players. The Chilean international Marcelo Salas scored the winner in the 76th minute.\n\nRiver Plate, which will face Brazil's Sao Paulo in the second leg of the South American Supercup final tomorrow, had midfielder Lionel Garcia sent off for a second caution and Roberto Montserrat for a bad tackle. All River Plate needs to win the championship again is a tie against Argetinos Juniors on Sunday, or a loss or tie by Boca Juniors in its match with Union.\n\nFIFA\n\nThe sport's world governing body has signed a marketing deal with a Switzerland-based company, I.S.L., through to the World Cup finals in 2006, FIFA announced yesterday. No financial details of the agreement were given, but officials said it was considerably larger than the previous agreement, which was worth $62.6 million. The new contract will cover all FIFA events until 2006, including the World Cup finals in Japan and South Korea in 2002 and the World Cup in 2006 for which the host has yet to be decided.\n\nSOCCER: NOTEBOOK"

Now picture you and Fido receiving tandem massages at the Las Ventanas al Paraiso resort in Los Cabos, Mexico (www.lasventanas.com), which also features special chef-prepared menus for canine guests. These are real travel options available right now; the only obstacle for big dogs is getting there.\n\nRock stars and business travelers who can afford it travel with their pets by private plane. For the rest of us, there are commercial flights, on which animals -- who now get frequent-flier miles on United and Midwest -- may ride in most airplanes' cabins, but only if they are small enough to fit in an approved underseat carrier or if they are licensed service animals like Seeing-Eye dogs. Larger canines must travel unsupervised in the cargo hold. And that's where the trouble starts. It's common for them to be loaded onto the wrong flight, suffer rough handling or poor ventilation, escape their crates or, worse, die while waiting on a freezing or boiling tarmac.\n\nFor decades, a luxury ocean liner was a big dog's only option. Seafaring dog lovers routinely booked passage aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2 to England, where bonded transport was arranged to shepherd them from the ship's kennel to a waiting ferry bound for France. By never actually touching down on British soil, the dog avoided a six-month quarantine. (This has since been revised; for details visit www.defra.gov.uk.) Now that the QE2 is retired from service, her successor, the Queen Mary 2 (www.cunard.com), offers the trip for $500.\n\nSpeaking of the Continent, Alitalia will let you fly on one of its Boeing 747 cargo planes bound for Milan, equipped with six seats and plenty of storage space. (These planes are regularly used to transport articles of extraordinary value, like horses, whose size and power demand that they be accompanied at all times in flight by a professional horse handler.) Dogs with the appropriate health certificates for their destination countries fly in airline-approved crates (the best on the market are made by Teja's Crates), while their owners sit a short flight of stairs away so that they can check up on their best friends during the seven-hour journey. To book, call Mersant International (718-978-8200); arrangements must be made at least 10 days in advance to allow time for a security background check. For two 80-pound dogs, the cost is $3,500 each way, plus the price of the seats, which sell at normal airfare rates.\n\nThat's not cheap, but it's less than chartering an aircraft through Jetworks (www.jetworkszcard.com). A $1,000 membership fee and another $80,500 will get you from Teterboro, N.J., to Rome and back in a midsize Hawker 1000 (cabin capacity: nine people and four big dogs); Paris is closer, so it's $70,700. It's up to you to split the cost by filling that plane with like-minded dog lovers.\n\nRichard Branson is banking on sending two-legged tourists to space on Virgin Galactic. This begs the question: why can't some entrepreneur create an airline just for dog lovers, with passenger seats attached to designer crates? The economic incentive is there -- the pet industry, now a healthy $34 billion a year, according to the American Pet Product Manufacturing Association (which also reports that 15 million Americans travel with their pets annually), has been growing steadily even in weak economic periods. Considering how big-dog lovers have already contributed their share to that figure, smart money says that they'd be more than happy to pay extra for the privilege of traveling alongside their animal companions."

        "document": "IN March, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to its lowest level since October 1992. Reports from the Commerce Department late last month showed that consumer spending had cooled in February, particularly for big-ticket purchases like cars.\n\nAs the United States was heading into war in Iraq, the economy was already slowing and consumer confidence receding. Once the war began, data from retailers showed that consumers were spending even less than they had before.\n\nThough the conflict's exact effects on consumer spending are difficult to measure, most reports on it have listed the war as an explanation for sluggish sales. If nothing else, the trend shows that consumers have been grappling with an ethical question: Is it appropriate to be spending while thousands of American soldiers are off fighting, or struggling to keep the peace?\n\n''We've got a case of national depression going on,'' said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's. ''People feel those guys over there are suffering. You don't feel like being self-indulgent.'' He pointed out that during the Persian Gulf war in 1991, the United States experienced the largest three-month drop ever in consumer confidence.\n\nBut does spending money, particularly on conspicuous goods and services like cars, entertainment or vacations, indicate a moral vacuum during a time of national crisis? If so, then why did President Bush ask the American people after the Sept. 11 attacks to show their support for the country by spending money?\n\nDuring World War II, Americans cut back on consumption and made sacrifices because the war effort created real shortages of goods. Absent such conditions during the current war, do we have an obligation to think twice before indulging?\n\n''There isn't anything inherently unethical about extravagant spending in a time of war,'' said Jon P. Gunnemann, a social ethics professor at Emory University in Atlanta. ''But there is an ethical component in both the re-examination of one's own priorities and the sense of solidarity with the people who are fighting the war, whether you agree with the war or not.'' There is a cultural ethos, he said, about ''what is fitting and what is not fitting.''\n\nCompanies, too, struggle to divine the appropriate behavior during war. After it began its spring pledge drive on March 20, a public radio station in Boston decided to suspend it the next day once the war was in full force. ''It became very obvious to us that this was not an appropriate time to fund-raise and we stopped it immediately,'' said Mary Stohn, a spokeswoman for the station, WBUR. The drive resumed April 8.\n\nRohit Deshpande, a marketing professor at Harvard Business School, said: ''Businesses aren't sure what the tone should be of any ad they run. Companies are leery about advertising and what's considered acceptable and what's considered bad taste.''\n\nMany of us take ethical accountings of ourselves during monumental events. Such events ''have an important impact on people's sense of themselves, their community and meaning,'' said Juliet B. Schor, a sociology professor at Boston College and author of ''The Overspent American: Why We Want What We Don't Need'' (HarperCollins, 1999). When people face events that have serious implications, she said, their daily lives feel unimportant. ''Shopping has a long history of being weighed down with the trivial,'' she said.\n\nOf course, when consumers stop spending, for any reason, the effects are counterproductive for the economy. But even a seasoned economist like Mr. Wyss sees nothing wrong with people asking during wartime whether it's appropriate to spend as much as they once did. ''I've reacted that way,'' he said. ''I don't really feel like having as much fun. It's a normal human response.''\n\nNo one has an ethical obligation to cut back on spending during times of war or other national crisis. But reassessing what is and isn't appropriate behavior is something that every ethical person should undertake, regardless of the ultimate decision.\n\nTHE RIGHT THING Jeffrey L.

        "document": "With a Soviet-style procession of goose-stepping troops, tanks, missiles and fighter jets setting the tone for the parade marking its 50 years of Communism, China showed off a formidable armory today, even if few of the weapons could match the latest Western models.\n\nThere were no technological surprises to cause gasps in Taiwan or in Washington. Still, military attaches from foreign embassies here eagerly studied the display through binoculars, viewing some of China's best antiaircraft missiles and other systems for the first time.\n\nYet potential foreign adversaries were not the main intended audience today, Chinese and Western experts said. ''The military parade is intended to show confidence and strength, especially domestically,'' said Zhang Yunding, director of Asia-Pacific Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ''It's to give the people a sense that we have a new China, to let people feel proud of that rather than to focus only on our current problems.''\n\nAny intimidation of Taiwan is an added benefit, Mr. Zhang said.\n\nJonathan Pollack, a China specialist at the Rand Corporation in California, said, ''The leadership wants to signal that it's not standing still and that it can display this prowess, at least as much to its own citizens as to the world at large.''\n\nToday's parade, the first of its kind in 15 years, also served the political ambitions of Jiang Zemin. In a stiff drive-by review of the forces today from an open-roofed limousine, Mr. Jiang imitated Deng Xiaoping's performance in 1984 and also showcased his own positions as chairman of the Central Military Commission, President of China and general secretary of the Communist Party.\n\nIf the tanks and jets on display today were a generation or so behind the world's best, the Chinese also displayed mobile short- and medium-range ballistic missiles that are nearly impossible to counter.\n\nChina still lacks the ability for sustained air and naval operations that would be necessary to invade well-defended Taiwan, 100 miles offshore and the main focus of Chinese military planning. And should the United States be drawn into combat, China would almost certainly be outfought by American ships and planes, which can strike precisely from hundreds of miles away.\n\nBut the mobile missiles on display today, which are being deployed adjacent to Taiwan in growing numbers, could serve in a sense as equalizers, able to inflict terrible damage on the island as well as on more distant American bases.\n\nThe parade also featured the recently tested DF-31 intercontinental ballistic missile, which can reach parts of the United States. Unlike China's existing, vulnerable nuclear forces, this weapon can be moved about, lending it far greater protection from surprise attack.\n\nThe military chest-thumping comes at a time when the long outmoded and underfunded military has gained status in top political circles and, almost certainly, a new boost in money for weapons development and purchases.\n\nMany of China's best weapons, including some fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles seen today as well as naval destroyers and submarines, have been purchased from Russia.\n\nChina's military spending is higher than the published budget shows. But even with recent increases and any new additions, most Western experts say, the total remains a fraction of the American military budget, forcing hard choices.\n\nThe generals' political stock is up these days, experts say, because the modernization of Chinese forces now seems all the more urgent.\n\nThe Americans' display of precision bombing in the Persian Gulf war of 1991 caused consternation in China's backward military and led to a major overhaul that is still going on. This spring, the long-distance prowess shown by the United States in its bombing campaign against Yugoslavia was, in the words of an army newspaper here, ''a new wake-up call'' to the Chinese military.\n\n''It was a big surprise to the military people,'' Mr. Zhang said. ''There's really pressure now to develop high-tech weapons.''\n\nThis summer's war of words with Taiwan, too, heightened the sense of urgency. In the months since Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, declared that relations between Taiwan and China should be conducted ''state to state,'' a statement Beijing took to be a step toward formal independence, the Chinese press has been filled with assertions about China's new capacity to easily vanquish Taiwan. But thus summer's crisis forced China's military and political leaders to confront how limited their military options actually are, especially with the specter of American involvement in Taiwan's defense.\n\nApart from backward technology, the Chinese military is in the throes of multiple transitions, and its leaders appear especially anxious to avoid any conflicts in the next few years, outside experts said.\n\nBurdened with a surplus of troops, a legacy of the old doctrine of ''people's war,'' the three-million-strong army is trying to reduce its numbers by another 500,000 after already pruning one million people in recent years. But the dearth of jobs for cashiered soldiers is slowing the process.\n\nThe military is also supposed to be ending its involvement in the myriad businesses that helped pay its bills in the past. It is revamping the organization of forces and is in the midst of a fundamental rewriting of military doctrine and strategy.\n\nDespite all these traumas, the military put on an impressively precise show today, even if it seemed from another era. ''The 50th anniversary was a special occasion,'' Mr. Zhang said. ''I think this is probably the last parade of this type.''"

        "document": "Worried about a political deadlock in Iraq and a spike in mayhem from an emboldened insurgency, the Bush administration has pressed Iraqi leaders in recent days to end their stalemate over forming a new government, with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Vice President Dick Cheney personally exhorting top Kurdish and Shiite politicians to come together.\n\nThe White House pressure, reported by Iraqi officials in Baghdad and an American official in Washington on Sunday, was a change in the administration's hands-off approach to Iraqi politics. The change was disclosed as insurgents unleashed a devastating technique, with twin double bombings at a police academy in Tikrit and an ice cream parlor in a Shiite neighborhood of Baghdad that killed 21 and wounded scores more.\n\nIn both attacks, a second bomb detonated within minutes after the first, killing and wounding policemen and bystanders who had rushed to care for victims of the initial blasts.\n\nThe explosions hit two of the favored targets of Sunni Arab insurgents: police recruits, whose training is critical to improving security in Iraq and providing the United States an exit strategy; and Shiites, who make up a majority in Iraq but nearly three months after national elections have yet to form a new government -- a failure that American officials fear is giving strength and confidence to the insurgents.\n\nWashington's approach to the political negotiations had emphasized that the Iraqis needed to form their own government without interference. But American and Iraqi officials have increasingly blamed the delay for a rise in violence in recent weeks that has killed more than a hundred Iraqis and threatens to destroy what remains of the political and security momentum that followed the successful Jan. 30 elections.\n\nMs. Rice on Friday telephoned Iraq's new president, Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, to urge him to complete the government ''as soon as they could'' and ''to get a status of where things were,'' a senior State Department official in Washington said Sunday. The official stressed that Ms. Rice did not tell Mr. Talabani how to form a government, just that the process needed to be concluded.\n\nAlso, Adil Abdul Mahdi, a leading Shiite politician selected as one of the new Iraqi vice presidents, met with Ms. Rice and Vice President Cheney at the White House, the official said, where he was also told that the White House wanted to see a government formed right away.\n\n''It has taken awhile, and this is also a reflection of the fact that the Iraqis themselves are pushing for a quicker government,'' the senior official said. Ms. Rice told both Mr. Talabani and Mr. Mahdi that more than enough time had passed, and a government needed to be formed now, the official said. ''We know it is not an easy thing to do, and this is the first time for them.''\n\nThe impact of the White House pressure was unclear. On Sunday, Shiite leaders once again predicted they were on the verge of announcing their new government, perhaps as soon as Monday. Similar predictions have been proved wrong several times in recent weeks.\n\nBut the Shiites added a new twist on Sunday, declaring they would no longer hold out for a deal with Ayad Allawi, the outgoing prime minister. Dr. Allawi, a secular Shiite who is not liked by the main Shiite political alliance, had demanded several key posts for his party, including either defense or interior minister, oil or finance minister, and deputy prime minister.\n\nIn an interview Sunday, Ali al-Adeeb -- a Shiite member of the National Assembly and a leader in Dawa, the party of the newly appointed prime minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari -- said, ''Allawi is out of the cabinet. We don't need any delay because of this issue.'' Many Shiites believe Dr. Allawi is too sympathetic to Sunnis, while many Kurdish officials fear Dr. Jaafari is too Islamist.\n\nLate Sunday, another Shiite alliance adviser cautioned that while the ''current discussions'' do not include Dr. Allawi, it was unfair to say he has been ruled out of the cabinet ''because there is no government yet.'' He predicted that the Shiites would not be able to announce a cabinet on Monday. A senior Allawi aide, Rasim al-Awadi, said Sunday afternoon that ''we've heard nothing yet from'' the Shiites about Dr. Allawi's demands for cabinet posts.\n\nThe Shiite alliance controls a narrow majority of the 275 seats in the National Assembly, while the Kurds have 75 seats and Dr. Allawi's party 40 seats. On top of the squabble between the Shiites and Dr. Allawi, some Kurdish political leaders and others have been trying to slow the political process to force Dr. Jaafari out of his new post. Under the interim constitution, the prime minister would relinquish the post if he fails to form a new government one month after his appointment. That clock runs out May 7.\n\nMany American officials say the political slowdown in Baghdad is hurting the ability of Iraqi security forces to repel and pursue insurgents. Some regional government leaders are appointing police and security officials without consulting with the Interior Ministry, as required by law. Elsewhere, American officials say, the political vacuum has led to apathetic law enforcement and public administration.\n\n''They need to get going on variety of fronts,'' an American official in Baghdad said Friday. ''None of the Iraqis we talk to think that the security situation in the past month has improved. A number of them think the security situation has grown more difficult.''\n\nThe violent streak that extended into Sunday began with the dual car-bomb strike at the police academy in Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown and a heartland for Sunni Baathists 100 miles north of Baghdad. A car bomb exploded inside the grounds of the academy, followed less than half an hour later by another bomb, an official at the Interior Ministry said. At least six Iraqis were killed and 30 wounded.\n\nSunday night a similar and deadlier strike hit the Al Riadhy ice cream parlor in the capital's Shula district, a working-class neighborhood in northwest Baghdad where many poor Shiites from places south like Kut and Diwaniyah migrated in the 1980's seeking work. The first bomber struck about 8:50 p.m., and the second blast rang out five minutes later, an Interior Ministry official said. At least 15 people were killed and 50 wounded.\n\nThe American military also reported two deaths at the hand of insurgents: On Saturday, a sailor assigned to the Second Marine Division was killed by a homemade bomb while conducting operations in Falluja. The Marines released no other details. In eastern Baghdad, a soldier from Task Force Baghdad was killed just after dawn on Sunday when his patrol was hit by a homemade bomb.\n\nMilitary officials also said they captured four more Iraqis suspected of involvement in the downing of a civilian helicopter last week that killed six American security contractors and five others. The four Iraqis join six Iraqi suspects who were seized early Saturday morning after Iraqi tipsters led soldiers to the suspects' truck and homes, according to military officials.\n\nAlso, Pakistani officials said Malik Mohammed Javed, a Pakistani Embassy official kidnapped two weeks ago in Iraq, was freed on Sunday.\n\n''He has reached the Pakistan Embassy in Baghdad,'' the Pakistani information minister, Sheik Rashid Ahmed, told The Associated Press. ''He is safe,'' Mr. Ahmed said, but he refused to provided any other information and declined to say whether ransom was paid.\n\nTHE CONFLICT IN IRAQ: POLITICS\n\nCorrection:  April 26, 2005, Tuesday  A front-page article yesterday about Bush administration pressure on Iraqi political leaders to reach a compromise on a government included an erroneous identification provided inadvertently by a State Department official for an Iraqi who had been telephoned by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. He was Massoud Barzani, leader of a main Kurdish political party, not Jalal Talabani, an Iraqi Kurd who is the new president."

        "document": "Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. intoned a message of freedom and equality while a pair of French ice dancers interpreted his words in tonight's free dance.\n\nSome contend that results in this sport are predetermined. Tonight's outcome did nothing to dispute that.\n\nThe French pair, Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat, led after the first three phases of the competition.  Irina Lobacheva and Ilya Averbukh of Russia were second and Barbara Fusar Poli and Maurizio Margaglio of Italy were third.\n\nTonight, all eyes seemed to be focused on the nine judges, who voted by 5 to 4 to award the Olympic gold medal to the French over the Russians. It was France's first gold medal in figure skating since 1932. The Italians took the bronze.\n\n''I feel like it's an historic day; I feel very proud, proud of having been able to come up here,'' said Peizerat, who won the bronze medal with Anissina in the 1998 Nagano Games.\n\nThe top eight couples stayed in the same order through the two compulsory dances, the original dance and the free dance, worth 50 percent of the total score.\n\nFollowing the controversy of the pairs competition over the past week, the ice dancing judges were under scrutiny. Six judges were from Eastern Europe, but there was no clear bloc voting. The Russian, Swiss, German and Italian judges favored the Russians tonight.\n\nPeizerat's outfit included a rope that coiled around his torso and down one leg, and Anissina's hair was dyed Raggedy Ann red. They skated to  ''Liberta'' by Jean-Claude Petit, accompanied by King's ''I Have a Dream'' speech.\n\n''If some people think it's inappropriate, I didn't hear about it,'' Peizerat said. ''Every time you take a risk in arts, because our sport gets 50 percent of art, you can find people that think it's inappropriate or different than what we're thinking. This is something we've been loving to dance, and we're proud of using this speech of expressing liberty on the ice.''\n\nSkating two pairs later, Margaglio fell when his skates became entangled with Poli's during their intricate step moves. That left the door open for the Canadians, Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz, to move up from fourth place. Bourne and Kraatz, however, had their own collapse while skating to a Michael Jackson medley.\n\nOn their final move, as Kraatz was lifting Bourne, they fell in a heap that they tried to pass off as planned.\n\nThe last couple to skate tonight, Lobacheva and Averbukh wore tattered costumes with sequins, she in white, he in black. Their routine, a tribute to Sept. 11, apparently did not impress the judges enough.\n\nLobacheva has been nursing a kneecap injury for most of the season. ''The trauma was serious, and it didn't have time for it to heal properly,'' Averbukh said.\n\nThey competed in the European championships, where they won the bronze medal.\n\nSuggestions of impropriety swirled throughout the evening, a results of the pairs judging controversy. In ice dancing, judges rate moves like twizzles, swing rolls and wishbones, not to mention the width of a smile and expressive hand gestures. Scoring is not based on more definable criteria like jumps and lifts.\n\nThe top Americans, Naomi Lang, 23, and Peter Tchernyshev, 30, who train at the Ice House in Hackensack, N.J., finished 11th. They believed they were at a disadvantage because no judge from the United States was on the panel.\n\n''It almost seems like there's a ranking order going on right now, unfortunately,'' Lang said. ''And without a judge on the panel, we kind of had no chance going into it today. All we could do is do our best. We just have to wait our turn.''\n\nLang said she was used to the subjectivity of judging, not that it makes it any easier.\n\n''It is frustrating that the judging has to be like this,'' she said. ''We did our jobs, that's all we could do.''\n\nTchernyshev added: ''We have to show the judges year after year that we're improving year after year. It's not just waiting.''\n\nBourne and Kraatz also finished fourth in Nagano.\n\nAnd just like Nagano, the Canadians entered tonight's free skate in fourth place.\n\nOLYMPICS: ICE DANCING"

        "document": "This fall, as attention focuses on the presidential race, James Carville, perhaps the nation's most visible political consultant, will be out promoting yet another of his money-making ventures -- a children's book, ''Lu and the Swamp Ghost,'' which was inspired by tales from his Louisiana childhood.\n\nIt's not that Mr. Carville has left politics behind. Hardly. It's just that Mr. Carville, largely by dint of energy and personality, has blended politics, entertainment and celebrity into a lucrative empire with a single product to sell: James Carville.\n\nMr. Carville is neither the book's author nor the illustrator. But he did provide the story and is the marquee name behind the book, which will be published in time to take advantage of the political season.\n\nWith the growth of 24-hour cable television and a vast appetite for political talk, Mr. Carville, who gained fame for helping engineer President Bill Clinton's 1992 victory, is at the head of a pack of political consultants who once toiled in obscurity but who are now finding fame and riches far from the campaign trail.\n\n''James is a multimedia corporation, and he's been smart about it,'' said Joe Lockhart, a former Clinton press secretary and a partner at the Glover Park Group, a communications consulting firm in Washington. ''He is a model of the future. This could not have happened pre-1992 when campaign consultants were viewed by a small audience. Now they are public celebrities.''\n\nAnd in that cult of political celebrity, Mr. Carville is far out front. He has written six political books, nearly all best sellers. He has advised political candidates from Bolivia to Israel to Mexico. He has had roles in two movies, most recently playing himself in the frat house comedy ''Old School'' as well as in six television shows and the canceled HBO series ''K Street,'' which featured him and his wife, Mary Matalin, a Republican strategist.\n\nWith access to some top names in Hollywood -- who are often Democratic donors -- he has a few new projects up his sleeve, among them a venture with the Hollywood producer Michael Medavoy to make a movie based on the life of the former governor of Louisiana Huey Long, as well as another attempt at an HBO series.\n\nIn Democratic circles, Mr. Carville is among the most active fund-raisers, political advisers and cheerleaders, especially as a co-host of the CNN program ''Crossfire'' and as a regular guest on the NBC program ''Meet the Press.'' He gives more than 100 speeches a year -- at $20,000 or more when making money for himself, and at no charge when he is a draw at Democratic fund-raisers. His closest political colleagues occupy top positions in the John Kerry campaign, and he has lent his face and recognizable voice to anti-Bush advertisements.\n\n''No political consultant has carved a space as unique as his,'' said Charles Lewis, executive director at the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington research group. ''He's become a commodity of himself by design.'' A longtime Washington observer, Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, put it more succinctly: ''He's a walking conglomerate.''\n\nWhile many in Washington may view Mr. Carville as overexposed, he plays well outside the Beltway. At a speech several weeks ago to a group of lawyers at the Tavern on the Green in Manhattan, he was greeted like a rock star. Young women angled for photos with him, the waiters gave him high fives.\n\nIt is a life he says he loves. ''I'm a ham,'' Mr. Carville said in an interview in a New York restaurant after his speech. ''I don't wish my anonymity back.''\n\nAnonymity is the last thing Mr. Carville craves, especially now that he is also a Madison Avenue pitchman. He is the voice for a $30 million advertising campaign for MetroOne Telecommunications to promote its directory assistance services. He has also done advertisements for Heineken beer, Nike, American Express, Alka-Seltzer, the Cotton Council, Ariba and Little Debbie, although some claim his personality often overwhelms the product.\n\n''I decided to make a living being me,'' Mr. Carville said. ''Anytime I try to be something other than James Carville, I have failed. The only time I have ever succeeded was being me. It was the smartest thing I have ever done.''\n\nYet his raucous persona can be an easy target for criticism, especially from conservatives irked by his finger-pointing at Republicans as a party of wealth. Clifford May, president at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a Washington nonprofit organization, and a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee, has often taken Mr. Carville to task.\n\n''You know, James, what's revolting -- what's revolting here, I'm afraid, is your hypocrisy,'' Mr. May said on a recent ''Crossfire'' program, ''for you to talk about special interests and financial contributions, when you've been the most successful person I know in gathering them.''\n\nSuch criticism hardly dents Mr. Carville. His first book, ''All's Fair,'' written with Ms. Matalin, had a $700,000 to $800,000 advance. A best seller, it started the couple's cottage industry with their political Punch-and-Judy routine on the lecture circuit.\n\nEach of his political books has sold over 100,000 copies, in part because of his ability to time political currents and his willingness to hit the road to promote sales. To promote his current book, ''Had Enough,'' which features a defiant-looking Mr. Carville on the cover with a black eye, he appeared, in the span of a month, on scores of national television and radio shows.\n\n''It's no coincidence his books come out at a certain moment in a political cycle,'' said David Rosenthal, his publisher at Simon & Schuster. ''The man is so well plugged-in, he might as well have wires attached.''\n\nHis weekly appearances on ''Crossfire'' add a mid-six-figure stream of cash to his income each year.\n\nHe has also worked as a consultant for candidates overseas, often with Stanley Greenberg, the former Clinton pollster, and Robert Shrum, the Kerry campaign media strategist, his partners in the Washington consulting firm GCS. Mr. Carville's foreign track record has been mixed, helping raise questions of whether American political consultants understand the cultural landscape of foreign countries.\n\n''U.S. political consultants are going around the world like carpetbaggers, where they often know nothing, including the language and the culture,'' said Mr. Lewis of the Center for Public Integrity.\n\nIn his win column was the 1999 come-from-behind victory for Ehud Barak, the former Israeli prime minister. But Mr. Carville stumbled in Mexico when he represented Francisco Labastida, whose party, the PRI, was ousted in 1992 amid charges of political corruption. And his 2002 Bolivian win for Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada turned sour when Mr. S\u00e1nchez was forced from office last year before the end of his term.\n\nMr. Carville is currently working with Venezuelan businessmen who are seeking to oust the leftist president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nMr. Carville, Mr. Greenberg and Mr. Shrum are also partners in Democracy Corps, a nonprofit group that uses polls to influence Democratic Party thinking. With an annual budget of $1.5 million, much of it from Hollywood, the group issues papers intended to aid Democratic officeholders.\n\nFor instance, based on polling, the group advised Congressional Democrats to back the war resolution on Iraq.\n\nFor the Democratic National Committee, Mr. Carville has lent his name to fund-raising letters and is a popular draw at state fund-raising dinners.\n\n''We are the pro bono side of Carville Inc.,'' said Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic National Committee chairman. ''Fame is very important. The more exposure he gets, the more I love it.''"

        "document": "A fishing boat laden with explosives blew up near an Israeli patrol ship off Gaza late Monday night, and Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian protester in Bethlehem today as violence continued to test the latest truce agreement.\n\nThe Israeli ship, which was not damaged, was patrolling near the Egyptian border on Monday night when officers spied a suspicious boat and headed toward it. Israeli authorities said they believed that the boat had detonated prematurely, killing a suicide bomber. They said that the boat had been traveling from Egyptian waters and that they believed that the bomber was Palestinian.\n\nNo group had claimed responsibility by this evening for what Israelis called attempted terrorism. Israeli authorities said they could not remember any previous bombing attempt at sea. And they repeated concerns that more attacks are likely, especially with Yasir Arafat and Prime Minister Ehud Barak heading to Washington this week to meet with President Clinton.\n\nClashes in the West Bank and Gaza left a 24-year-old Palestinian dead near the shrine in Bethlehem known as Rachel's Tomb. Israeli soldiers said they shot the man, Abdallah Amarneh, after he shot at them.\n\nAnother Palestinian died in Gaza of wounds suffered last week. About 180 have died since the conflict began five weeks ago, almost all of them Palestinians.\n\nStill, the Israeli government said the number of violent incidents has declined by 40 percent since a former prime minister, Shimon Peres, hammered out a truce with Mr. Arafat last Thursday. Palestinian officials have made an effort to restrain youths from reaching Israeli checkpoints and hurling stones and firebombs, Israeli officials said.\n\nA senior Palestinian official, Yasir Abed Rabbo, said the Palestinian Authority was beginning a campaign to discourage children under 16 from taking part in violence. ''But it hasn't been quiet yet, unfortunately,'' said Nahman Shai, the Israeli government spokesman.\n\nSince the agreement on Thursday, the Israelis and Palestinians have made a greater effort to cooperate. Israeli news media reports said Avi Dichter, Israel's chief of internal security, met in Cairo over the weekend with senior Palestinian security officials. Mr. Barak allowed the Gaza airport, which has been shut down three times in the last five weeks, to reopen this morning.\n\nPalestinian officials continue to accuse Israelis of using excessive force. They repeated their call today for an armed ''international protection force'' to be sent to Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as part of their effort to internationalize the brokering of a peace effort.\n\nThe Israelis emphatically reject the idea of an international peace force, and both President Clinton and the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, said it would not happen if the Israelis opposed it. Mr. Arafat's advisers said he would nonetheless press the point with Mr. Clinton when the two men meet on Thursday. Mr. Barak is scheduled to see Mr. Clinton on Sunday.\n\nLt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli Army chief of staff, said Israeli Defense Forces are making emergency preparations in the event the conflict spreads.\n\n''I think that if the confrontation with the Palestinians continues and the height of the flames rises and if, God forbid, there were fire on the northern border, those things together could bring about regional deterioration,'' he said. ''I don't mean to say it will happen. But we are obligated to raise the level of preparedness of the Israeli Army as a result of the strategic situation.''\n\nTouring northern Israel, Mr. Barak said the Lebanese border was tense, especially near the disputed Shebaa Farms area. A senior Israeli security official said Hezbollah guerrillas were believed to be planning a sizable attack on Israeli border positions.\n\nAsked about Lebanese reports that an Israeli helicopter gunship had touched down in Lebanon on Monday, Mr. Barak said, ''No helicopter of ours has landed in Lebanon.''\n\nIsraeli officials would not comment on reports that fighter planes have been flying in and out of Lebanese air space, though many northern Israelis have clearly heard the planes come and go. Lebanese residents said they broke the sound barrier several times.\n\nAnd Israeli officials have barely uttered a word publicly about the four Israelis who were captured by Hezbollah early last month. The Lebanese are anxious about how Israel will respond."

With a following that goes well beyond just a cult niche, they have left their country dizzy with their success over the last decade years.\n\nTonight, a swarm of chanting Aussies packed the hockey stadium for their beloved team's gold-medal match against Argentina. And by the end of their 3-1 victory, after the Hockeyroos had dismantled their opponent's will with their deceptive stick skills, opportunistic scoring and aggressive attack, they were free to enjoy the buildup to their gold medal.\n\nWhile the crowd counted down the last 10 seconds in a crescendo, the Hockeyroos embraced each other, linked arms like papers dolls and started celebrating. The Olympic favorites -- a team that has now won three gold medals in a row -- could finally feel relief.\n\n''I must say there was some tension,'' said Rechelle Hawkes. ''There were a few girls who were nervous. It was pretty quiet before we came out. But once it started, we all came together.''\n\nNow, some of them will be going their own way.Richard Charlesworth, the coach and the adored taskmaster who pushed his team to be perfectionists, but was visibly moved as he watched his players bask in their moment, is expected to depart.\n\n''Afterward, he just stood up briefly and said he was really, really proud of us,'' said Jenny Morris. ''He had some tears in his eyes.''\n\nOthers were waiting for the emotional impact of the night to hit them. At age 32, Hawkes is retiring from competition with three gold medals, equaling the total of Australian icon Dawn Fraser.\n\n''To be mentioned in the same breath as Dawn Fraser is amazing, but I couldn't have done it without this team,'' Hawkes said. ''Winning in Atlanta was special, but this is the best way to go out. I'm really just over the moon.''\n\nShe was among the many. As the team completed a victory lap around the field, the steel-framed stadium trembled with the roar, but perhaps the most touching display of admiration came from Argentina. The silver medalists lined up in two parallel rows, formed a bridge with their hands, and then ushered the Aussies through their gauntlet as a show of respect.\n\n''What we achieved was important,'' said goalkeeper Mariela Antoniska, who endured a flurry of 17 attempts, saved a remarkable 14 of the shots but wept after the game. ''I'm disappointed, but Australia is a very good team.''\n\nThe Aussies have been excelling for years. Under Charlesworth, the team's reputation as intimidators has flourished. They are not dirty, but hard-nosed. If they are hurt, his players refuse to show it. If they are afraid, they learn to hide it. Tonight, the Aussies were anxious beneath their fagade but shook it off in the opening minutes.\n\nAlthough they missed some early shots, some of which glanced off the goalposts, the Australians were on the attack. Nine minutes into the game, Alyson Annan slipped in front of the net and used her stick like a pool cue. Faced with a thicket of legs and sticks, she poked the ball past a diving Antoniska.\n\nJust before the first half, the Aussies took a 2-0 lead after they converted a penalty corner opportunity into a goal. This time, a quick-thinking Juliet Haslam was in the right place to turn a deflection off the post into a goal.\n\nInstead of allowing Argentina to get back into the game, Australia opened the second half by taking advantage of another penalty corner situation. Three minutes into play, Morris reached out and slashed the ball in between defenders and into the net from the top of the circle. Ahead 3-0, the Aussies were revealing just how dominating they have come to be, and why they are the pride of their country.\n\n''I don't know if anything prepares you for the emotion of this,'' said Morris, who had difficulty speaking without getting emotional. ''This is a bloody great night. To win a gold here is just amazing.''\n\nIn the process, the rest of the world came to discover the answer to, What's a Hockeyroo?\n\nSYDNEY 2000: FIELD HOCKEY"

        "document": "The first thing Prime Minister Ariel Sharon will do this week is to prove the case -- with captured documents and the transcripts of interrogations of Yasir Arafat's closest terrorist aides -- that the blood of innocent Israeli civilians, and of over a thousand Palestinians as well, is on Arafat's hands.\n\nThe reaction of Palestinian propagandists will be ''pack of lies.'' European diplomats will shrug off the evidence with a cool ''unproven.'' President Bush will likely say: sure, you make a powerful case that terrorism was his choice, and I believe it, but what else is new? You have to make peace with the leader with whom you are fighting a war.\n\nIf that is the predictable reaction, why do the Israelis set such store in proving Arafat's personal guilt?\n\nThe reason, I think, is that any future agreement must be based on performance, not promises. That would require provisional, interim agreements, dependent on peaceful behavior, and not a comprehensive final deal imposed and enforced by outsiders based on the quicksand of mutual distrust.\n\nIsrael has reluctantly accommodated the U.S. by releasing Arafat instead of exiling him. It sees him as the terrorist problem, not its solution. If the Arab world insists on making him the central Arab interlocutor rather than a figurehead, it will be a long negotiation before Palestinian statehood.\n\nBut a negotiation there must be. It will not start from the misbegotten ''bridging'' deal proposed by Bill Clinton and rejected by Arafat in his calamitous bid for all or nothing.\n\nParadoxically, negotiations can start from the Saudi proposal, which takes an equally extreme initial position: return by Israel to indefensible 1967 borders, Palestinian statehood with division of Jerusalem and assorted other claims, in return for full normalization by all 22 Arab states.\n\nA generation ago, Egypt's Anwar Sadat made a similarly sweeping pre-1967 proposal, but settled for the Sinai in return for Egyptian normalization. In genuine negotiation, initial positions are not final positions.\n\nWith a Saudi proposal in hand, approved by many Arab states, it is for Israel now to come up with a counterproposal. Its outline is what Sharon is presumably bringing to the Bush White House this week.\n\nIf it follows the lines he sketched in this space last month, it will include a cease-fire with U.S. monitors as well as a separation of the opposing forces with a buffer zone. This would not be a simple fence or wall, but a two-to-three-mile zone of electronic sensors and barriers, patrolled on foot and by helicopter by Israeli defense forces. The zone would include 80 percent of the Jewish suburbanites and villagers whom Arabs call ''settlers.''\n\nAs I get it, Israel would not formally annex this buffer zone, instead leaving the issue of sovereignty to the final agreement on borders. In the same way, Israel will also keep its defenses along the Jordan Valley, both to protect itself from Iraqi tanks and to protect Jordan from vengeful Palestinians.\n\nWith security in place and terrorism no longer official Palestinian policy -- indeed, with action taken by Arabs in authority to crush it -- negotiations could proceed.\n\nForget about the desperation of politicians under deadline pressure at Camp David and Taba: that was in another country and besides, after two years of terror, the appeasement wench is dead. A gang of four -- Europe's Solana, the U.N.'s Annan, Russia's Ivanov and maybe the U.S.'s Powell -- may try to revive her, but the prewar deal based on dovish dreams is a nonstarter.\n\nSteps to an interim agreement can be taken, however. If the Arabs can give a little on their insistence on ''all'' territory, the word deliberately not used in Resolution 242, so can the Israelis -- in my view -- compromise by not keeping ''all'' so-called settlements. The city of Jerusalem could encompass the Arab village of Abu Dis, capital of a Palestinian state.\n\nAs a sweetener, we could have the ''Bush-Sharon-Abdullah Plan,'' organizing global investment in Palestinian agricultural, desalination and technical development. That would bring Palestinians independence not just in name but in fact.\n\nMinisterial meetings lead to direct talks. A sensible compromise is ultimately there to be made. Sometimes a battle-scarred warrior is best suited to be the man of peace.\n\nE-mail: safire@nytimes.com"

        "document": "With the release this morning of the Sept. 11 commission's final report, not quite three years after the attacks, the country will receive an account of the day no longer anchored in the shock of the moment, but one that peels open layers of the federal government that are rarely glimpsed, much less scrutinized.\n\nThe version of events that evolved from those secret records reflects a profound shift. The inquiry established that the attacks, rather than being bolts from the blue, were preceded by a rising tide of unheard, ignored or mishandled warnings of pending trouble. The hearings and interim reports revealed years of troubling entanglements with other countries and evidence of a fractured national intelligence system of squabbling, uncommunicative agencies.\n\nThe commission has cut more quickly and deeply into the secrets of two presidential administrations than did earlier commissions that studied national calamities, such as Pearl Harbor, the John F. Kennedy assassination and the Iran-contra affair, according to scholars on the presidency and secrecy.\n\nOften, the scholars said, this kind of historical overhaul takes years or decades, but the pressures of a presidential election year and the persistent inquiries of victims' families meant that closely guarded secrets and embarrassing lapses were revealed with remarkable speed.\n\n''The commission has been given pretty extraordinary free rein, particularly in the area of national security, an area that past presidents have been most vigilant in claiming the right to withhold information,'' said Mark J. Rozell, a professor of public policy at George Mason University and an authority on presidential secrecy. ''They had access to presidential policy directives, to information that is normally for the president's eyes only, and documents that political scientists and historians normally would not be able to get for years.''\n\nPresident Bush promised that his administration would cooperate with any inquiry that had the goal of making the country safer. From the outset, though, the White House had a difficult relationship with the commission, and in one confrontation after another the administration and its allies were forced to retreat. The victims' families, it turned out, were a rare force in Washington, with leverage that was not negotiable in ordinary political terms.\n\nTheir status gave them general -- though hardly absolute -- immunity from accusations that they were seeking partisan advantage, or that by asking questions about what went wrong they were subverting a president leading a war in one country and preparing for an invasion in a second one.\n\nThe families were ''a huge factor, they were present every day in the hearings,'' said Louis Fisher, a scholar of executive privilege who works for the Congressional research service of the Library of Congress.\n\nPatricia Casazza, whose husband, John, was killed at the World Trade Center, said that she and others had been moved by the families of people killed in the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. ''When they met with us, they said that on 9/11 they felt that they had failed us,'' Ms. Casazza said. ''They had been pushing to have the cockpit doors hardened for 13 years, and they had not gotten it done. I, in turn, felt we had failed in not supporting them. I didn't want to turn around to the next victims and say we didn't try.''\n\nEven before the commission was formed, a joint committee of the Senate and the House issued a report on the Sept. 11 attacks for the first anniversary, but that investigation encountered rigid limits on access to intelligence information.\n\nSixty years earlier, similar problems confounded the first inquiries into the attack on Pearl Harbor, said Donald M. Goldstein, a professor of public and international affairs at the University of Pittsburgh and an authority on those investigations. Because President Franklin D. Roosevelt had immediately declared war, many details of America's prewar intelligence -- including intercepted messages that appeared, in retrospect, to provide warning of an attack -- were not revealed until a definitive Congressional study in 1946, a year after the war ended, Mr. Goldstein said. More information has trickled out over the years.\n\nThe terms for the Sept. 11 commission -- bipartisan, 10 members, subpoenas issued on a majority vote, and an appointment that was to end in 18 months -- were not finally settled and signed into law by the president until Nov. 27, 2002. While the commission began hearings and collecting information quickly, some agencies were slow to respond. The delay galled families who saw months run out during the wait for records.\n\n''They did not use the subpoena power early enough and often enough,'' said Bill Harvey, whose wife, Sara Manley, was killed at the trade center.\n\nThe families agitated for the use of subpoenas, resisting the notion that independent commissions were a waste of time, said Kristen Breitweiser, whose husband, Ronald, also died in the trade center. Nearly a year into the commission's term, subpoenas were issued to the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Defense and the City of New York.\n\nEarly this year, against the wishes of J. Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House of Representatives, they lobbied for an extension of the term of the commission and won an additional two months.\n\nIn the spring, the administration at first refused to permit the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, to testify, saying the president was entitled under the Constitution to confidential advice. Then the administration retreated. The unanimity of the commission was important, Mr. Fisher said, in affecting the administration's change of heart, as was the determination of the families.\n\nMr. Rozell, the author of ''Executive Privilege: Presidential Power, Secrecy, and Accountability'' (second edition, University Press of Kansas, 2002), said it would be hopeless for the president to undertake any broad effort at secrecy during an election year, particularly with a vocal group like the families monitoring the administration's cooperation. ''The fact that the family members were well organized and demanded the commission be able to fully investigate was very powerful,'' Mr. Rozell said. ''It made it doubly hard for the president to put up any roadblocks in this area.''\n\nEven so, the commission's success may not be known for years, said Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian. ''What you don't know is what Americans will learn 20 years from now about where the commission may not have had access to important information, and other areas where they might have been shortsighted,'' Mr. Beschloss said.\n\nFor her part, Ms. Breitweiser said that the commission had provided enough details on needed reforms, and that she and other victims' relatives would seek a meeting with the White House in early August to push for them. ''The clock is ticking on the next attack,'' she said.\n\nTHREATS AND RESPONSES: THE HISTORY"

        "document": "Responding to the scandal over alleged Russian money laundering, the Clinton Administration has offered two basic defenses of its Russia policy: 1) that it has long known about crime and corruption (Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott), and 2) that we must stay engaged with Russia for our national security (Samuel Berger, national security adviser). Both of these statements are true. So what is wrong with this picture?\n\nOf course the Administration has been aware of the crime and corruption and has known that this has been much more than mafia-type activity. It has known that ''reform'' was the entrenchment of a kleptocracy in which corrupt officials ally with a very few business magnates to send wealth out of the country.\n\nIt has been crony capitalism without much capitalism. But the Administration wrote off the top-to-bottom corruption of what it proclaimed as Russian reform. It also discouraged candid intelligence and diplomatic reports about it, as former officials are now revealing. This silence protected our policy, especially International Monetary Fund lending.\n\nNo audience has found this more offensive than have the Russians themselves, for they, along with anyone who bothered to read their press, knew the truth. In Washington a few months ago, Georgi Arbatov, the old warhorse of Soviet propaganda, recalled President Clinton's saying in Moscow last September that if the Russians continued down the path of reform, they would get more international support (that is, I.M.F. and other lending).\n\nGiven the plundering and impoverishment that ''the path of reform'' has meant, Mr. Arbatov asked, how could Russians not suspect that the United States was deliberately conniving in the wrecking of their country? For once, after decades of sparring over cold war issues, I had to tell Mr. Arbatov that I agreed with him fully.\n\nSo why this charade on our part? The Administration implies in public and pleads explicitly in private that we had to support the Yeltsin regime, despite the corruption and the murderous Chechen war, because we needed its cooperation on security issues from arms control to proliferation to the Balkans. These are important interests. And valuable things have been achieved, like dismantlement of Russian strategic missiles and improved security at some nuclear sites. No nukes have got loose yet, so far as we know.\n\nBut we have to ask: is our overall security relationship with Russia in better shape today than it was in 1993? The answer is clearly no. Diplomatic relations are testy. Arms control is frozen. The danger that nuclear and other weapons might leak out of Russia is hardly diminished. Russian elites are more interested in undermining American superpower status than in cooperation.\n\nWorst of all, we have largely lost the admiration and respect of the Russian people that we had six years ago, because of the perversity of the reforms we have been applauding. Was this ''bargain'' worth it, especially since it jeopardized our long-term goal in Russia, its development of real democracy and capitalism?\n\nThink how the Administration's ''defense'' must look to Russians: you support the regime's corruption of our country on the inside so it supports you in your humiliation of our country on the outside. One could not concoct a better propaganda line for Russia's extreme nationalists.\n\nThis defense will not wash. We had other options: a more critical stance toward the regime, tighter conditions on lending, and, above all, more honesty. Because Russia spans 10 time zones, possesses thousands of nuclear weapons and could influence the fate of democracy in the next century, Mr. Talbott and Mr. Berger are right: we must remain engaged with Russia. But not their way.\n\nFritz W. Ermarth was a senior officer of the Central Intelligence Agency who retired in October 1998.

Among those expected in the men's field are the American Olympians Tom Nohilly, a steeplechaser, and Mark Coogan, a marathoner. The women's field will most likely include two leading American milers, Alisa Harvey Hill and Kathy Franey, and the Irish Olympian Sinead Delahunty.\n\nThe featured mile will be the main event at the fourth annual New Balance Games, a daylong track and field competition featuring some of the area's top high school athletes.\n\nIn 1996, New Balance, which is based in Boston, offered $1 million to any American runner -- male or female -- who could break the American marathon record, which stood at 2 hours 8 minutes 47 seconds for men and 2:21:21 for women. A year later, the company upped the ante to $2 million after no one rose to the challenge.\n\n''The idea was to promote and give incentive to American runners,'' said Frank Shorter, a former Olympic marathon champion and a spokesman for New Balance. ''We thought that within the current group of marathoners, someone would take a year off or cut down on their races and try to break the record. We learned our lesson.''\n\nTRACK AND FIELD"

Going through the airport yesterday was a nightmare. Some people are nice about it, but I'm standing there in the gift shop trying to buy a magazine when this woman starts screaming my name. I didn't even turn around. It was so annoying and embarrassing. There were 15 people in the store staring at me.\n\nThis year, I pretty much stopped reading what people write about me. I'm pretty sensitive. I used to read the tennis magazines, and inevitably I'd run across something about me that wasn't nice and it would bother me so much. At the Lipton tournament in March, I donated $10,000 to Arthur Ashe's charity and there was a raffle drawing afterward, which I didn't win. It was no big deal. Later I read something in a magazine like, Maybe she didn't win the raffle because she never wins the big tournament.\n\nI couldn't believe it! I gave to charity and got ripped for it.\n\nCorrection:  October 18, 1998, Sunday  An article on page 98 of The Times Magazine today about the tennis player Lindsay Davenport misstates her ranking on the Women's Tennis Association tour.

        "document": "The march toward winning the bid for the 2012 Olympic Games has gone something like a Busby Berkeley musical, with a ''let's put on a show'' kind of enthusiasm from New York boosters. But now that the United States Olympic Committee has selected New York over San Francisco as the American entry in the competition for the 2012 Summer Games, planners will need to get serious. Public debate about their ideas must begin well before the point of no return in 2005, when the International Olympic Committee chooses one host city from a tough list of competitors.\n\nThe New York proposal won the domestic contest in large part because it is grand, inventive and appealing, promising accommodations that are world class for athletes and spectators. Once those people are gone, the city would benefit from the new buildings, sports facilities and mass-transit service left behind. Some of the plans are for projects the city has needed for a long time -- the deadline pressure of the Games could force New York to do things that it should have been doing anyway. But there are other areas where the bid bears closer examination.\n\nCentral to the proposal is the future of the far West Side of Midtown Manhattan, over and around the Hudson rail yards. The area, which has only 130 legal residences, represents the final frontier for development in Manhattan. As Deputy Mayor Daniel Doctoroff, the longtime Olympic booster, likes to point out, the Games can provide the catalyst to put the space to income-generating use. Even if New York does not ultimately win the bid, City Hall wants to proceed with the development.\n\nAll this makes sense, particularly extension of the No. 7 subway line to an area that desperately needs subway service to encourage growth, and an expansion of the Javits Center. We're less convinced about building a stadium to seat 86,000 people on a platform above the rail yards. The total price tag of at least $3 billion, which would also underwrite hotels and a park, is supposed to be largely covered by bonds, which would later be paid off by future tax revenues from the newly developed area. That part of the scheme may pose risks if businesses fail to move in as planners anticipate.\n\nNow that the Olympic plans will have the public's attention, City Hall must explain how that risk would be minimized. And it needs to bolster its argument for a stadium in an urban area peppered with arenas. Large stadiums tend to deaden, not enliven, surrounding neighborhoods. Even if the New York Jets pay for the facility -- something not set in concrete -- financing the $500 million platform and roof would fall to the city. While less glamorous, a refurbished Shea Stadium could be used for the Olympics. It is an option that bears exploring."

        "document": "Neighbors and co-workers describe Astrid Eyzaguirre as a chatty, vivacious woman who bounced through several jobs at the military shopping center in this romantic university town where the European headquarters of the United States Army is based.\n\nIt may have been her chattiness that led Ms. Eyzaguirre to warn a colleague at the liquor store where she worked not to come in next Wednesday, Sept. 11. Something bad, she said, was going to happen that day.\n\nHer colleague reported the remark to the military police, according to several people who work at the shopping center, and the military tipped off the F.B.I., which told German authorities. At midday on Thursday, the German police turned up at the apartment shared by Ms. Eyzaguirre, 23, who was born in Germany of an American father and a German mother, and her fianc\u00e9, Osman Petmezci, a German of Turkish background. They lived in the village of Walldorf, 16 miles south of here.\n\nThe police found 287 pounds of chemicals, five pipe bombs, and a picture of Osama bin Laden in the apartment, and immediately arrested the couple, on suspicion of plotting an attack on the American military at Heidelberg.\n\nGerman officials said they doubted that the couple had links to Al Qaeda or other terrorists, but Mr. Petmezci, who worked at a chemical plant in nearby Karlsruhe, was initially described as a religiously motivated anti-American.\n\nInterior Minister Otto Schily said today, though, that, ''Based on what we know so far, we are dealing with an individual who has shown no indication of participation in a terrorist network.''\n\nTurkish militant groups exist in Germany, but Turks have not figured prominently in the investigations related to the September attacks. Federal prosecutors have not decided whether to handle the case, while state authorities in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, where Heidelberg is located, say the suspects are not cooperating. That has deepened the mystery surrounding Ms. Eyzaguirre and Mr. Petmezci, 25, who was brought up in Germany by a pious Muslim family.\n\nOn Thursday, the interior minister of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Thomas Sch\u00e4uble, said Mr. Petmezci ''seems to be a follower of Osama bin Laden who is deeply religious and harbors a hatred for Americans and Jews.'' Mr. Sch\u00e4uble added that he had information that Ms. Eyzaguirre ''hated Jews as well.''\n\nAt the shopping center, where talk of the arrests was on everybody's lips, people who knew Ms. Eyzaguirre were baffled.\n\n''She was absolutely the last person you would expect to get mixed up with a religious fanatic,'' said a sales clerk, as he checked the identity cards of entering customers.\n\nCompounding the shock among people here, Ms. Eyzaguirre holds an American passport. Her father was in the United States military, an American official said.\n\nJessica Rosarius, who lives two doors down from the couple's apartment and works in a bar on a nearby base, said, ''What really upsets me is that she is an American and that she was planning this.''\n\nPeople who know Mr. Petmezci say his father and uncle are active in Islamic groups in Walldorf, which has a large Turkish population and a recently built mosque on the outskirts of town. But they said Mr. Petmezci was not himself outwardly fervent.\n\n''His father and he did not have much to do with each other,'' said a postal worker who is Turkish and lives next door to Mr. Petmezci's parents. ''He was like anybody, just a normal guy.''\n\nKarl Henz, who lived downstairs from the couple, said he sometimes encountered Mr. Petmezci in the evenings when he and Ms. Eyzaguirre went out to a disco. He said Mr. Petmezci was unfailingly courteous and seemed concerned about his clothes and appearance.\n\nMs. Rosarius said Mr. Petmezci spoke excellent English. She said she sometimes saw him driving Ms. Eyzaguirre's car, a white Honda with United States military license plates.\n\nMs. Eyzaguirre was an employee of the PX, military parlance for the post exchange, the shops for soldiers and their families. She had a pass that allowed her entry to the PX and other base facilities without an extensive search.\n\nThe exact target of a possible plot is not clear, but this medieval town is rich in opportunities. About 16,000 American military personnel and their families live in Heidelberg, many near Campbell Barracks, which houses NATO offices in addition to the army's European headquarters.\n\nThree soldiers with automatic weapons guarded the main entrance of the base today. Officials said they had not clamped down on security since the arrests, though it had been tightened after the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nThe headquarters is in a 1930's-era building next to a main road. Though it is protected by concrete barriers and barbed wire, a car or truck laden with explosives could get within 20 feet of it. Apartments housing military families line both sides of the road. They have only low hedges and an occasional sentry post. Children play on a jungle gym with nothing separating them from the street.\n\nAt the PX, a mile from Campbell Barracks, soldiers checked cars at the entrance, pulling aside a few for random inspections. Still, the parking lot was full and shoppers did not seem visibly alarmed.\n\n''I think people are taking this in stride,'' said Col. Carl J. Kropf, the chief of public affairs for the army's European headquarters. ''I think people understand the context in which we live these days.''\n\nCol. William Taylor 3d, the commander of the Army Air Force Exchange Service in Europe, which oversees PX's, paid a visit to the shopping center early this afternoon to reassure visitors about security.\n\nNot everyone was easily soothed. Soorin, who has run the dry cleaner at the PX for 35 years and who would give only her first name, said: ''Of course I'm afraid of an attack. I'm afraid every day.'' She hastened to add that she was of Armenian, not Turkish, background.\n\nTHREATS AND RESPONSES: GERMANY"

Muhammad Fahim, the defense minister, and Yunus Qanooni, the interior minister -- were on hand to welcome Mr. Karzai with apparent enthusiasm.\n\nThe third, the provisional government's foreign minister, Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, was in New Delhi meeting with Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and visiting relatives. Mr. Qanooni, who also has family in India, met with Indian leaders last week.\n\nAides to Dr. Abdullah said he wholeheartedly backed Mr. Karzai and the accord.\n\nGeneral Fahim guided Mr. Karzai from the moment he landed Wednesday night on a runway lined with Kabul's most powerful figures and today escorted him to meetings with scores more.\n\nGeneral Fahim and Mr. Qanooni, who are both Tajiks, appeared to be eager to show they can be trusted to provide security for leaders from other ethnic groups, like Mr. Karzai, a Pashtun. Dr. Abdullah is half-Tajik and half-Pashtun.\n\nAfter giving many interviews in southern Afghanistan, Mr. Karzai refrained from holding a triumphant news conference in the capital today in an apparent effort to avoid upstaging Burhannudin Rabbani, the outgoing president of the Northern Alliance. During his visit, Mr. Karzai is being described as Mr. Rabbani's guest.\n\nWhen Mr. Karzai takes office on Dec. 22, Mr. Rabbani and another religious conservative, Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, will essentially be stripped of all power. Both men met with Mr. Karzai today.\n\nMr. Rabbani has criticized the makeup of the interim government, as have several lower-level commanders. Their complaint is that the Bonn agreement concentrates too much power in the three young moderates.\n\nBut Mr. Rabbani, like other commanders, has said he will work within the agreement to increase his party's representation, particularly at a grand council that is to be held in the next six months.\n\nTonight, Mr. Karzai met with Francesc Vendrell, the deputy United Nations ambassador to Afghanistan. On Friday, he is expected to visit the grave of the slain alliance commander, Amhed Shah Massoud, in the Panjshir Valley, a gesture to the alliance.\n\nWhile the Bonn agreement is being celebrated in Kabul, it is being accepted, but not embraced, by the leader in western Afghanistan, Ismail Khan. At a news conference this evening, Mr. Khan, now the governor-general of Herat, sounded less than thrilled with the agreement, although his son has been appointed minister of labor and social welfare in the new government.\n\n''I am not seeking personal power,'' Mr. Khan said. ''We are already blessed that we got rid of the Taliban in this area.'' His concern, he said, was that the five provinces putatively under his control make up one third of the country's territory, but have been allotted only two cabinet ministers in the new government.\n\n''My complaint is that the rights of the people of this region have not been respected,'' Mr. Khan said. ''We do not have proper representation.''\n\nBut he also indicated that he hoped the new government would sort the problems out. ''We hope they will review this in the new cabinet in the future,'' he said.\n\nA NATION CHALLENGED: ENTERING KABUL"

        "document": "Now that it appears obvious that the Grumman Mallard seaplane that crashed Monday off Miami had metal fatigue, the airline and the Federal Aviation Administration are devising a way to inspect the four remaining Mallards for the same problem.\n\nBut the difficulty they face may illustrate why the problem was not discovered in the plane before it crashed.\n\nMark V. Rosenker, acting chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said Thursday that getting to the wing beam that came apart in the crash would require peeling back the metal skin of the plane.\n\nThough many planes are carefully inspected for metal fatigue, it is much harder to find on models that are not extensively used, said John Goglia, an airplane maintenance expert and former member of the safety board.\n\nOnly four Mallards -- all built 50 years ago or more -- are operated commercially, all owned by the operator of the plane in Monday's crash, Chalk's Ocean Airways, so that airline never has the benefit of the experience of other carriers, Mr. Goglia said.\n\nHe noted that aircraft produced by companies that still existed usually had the manufacturer behind them.\n\n''In this case, the manufacturer is gone, and there's probably nobody providing the support, so it increases responsibility on the operator,'' said Mr. Goglia, who is now a professor of aviation science at St. Louis University.\n\nThe board made the problem obvious on Thursday when it posted photographs on its Web site of the broken metal part, which shows the ''beach marks'' characteristic of metal fatigue. These are curvy lines, like those left in the sand by waves, showing flaws created by different stresses.\n\nFatigue can be found by a variety of inspection techniques, experts say, and the spot where it was found in the wreckage, on the spar, an internal beam near the fuselage, is the first place to look, said George H. Kizner, chairman of the mechanical engineering department at Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology, in Queens.\n\n''That's where the stresses are the maximum,'' Mr. Kizner said.\n\nMr. Rosenker said his investigators were cutting the same part out of the opposite wing, to send it to a laboratory for analysis and to see whether it also showed fatigue.\n\nOne method for finding fatigue before an accident is to spread a dye on the metal, wait for it to seep into cracks and then wipe the surface clean. Then the technician puts a ''developer'' powder on the surface and waits for it to suck dye back out of the cracks, making the cracks more obvious.\n\nAnother is to put iron filings on the part being tested and run a current through the metal; the filings will gather at the cracks, because those are magnetic poles.\n\nAnother is to run electricity through the part and measure the magnetic field; cracks will produce a disrupted field.\n\nTechnicians can also use ultrasound; they spread petroleum jelly on the object to be tested and bounce sound waves off the target. Just as in medical diagnosis, the ultrasound will reveal internal structures, including cracks.\n\nThe safety board is probably months away from concluding that metal fatigue was the immediate cause of the Miami crash, said people with experience in its investigations. Mr. Rosenker went so far as to say that fatigue was ''certainly one of the elements that is extremely interesting to us.''\n\nBut the board only reaches conclusions when its members vote on a final report.\n\nInvestigators will also look into other questions, experts said. Mr. Goglia, who was on the board from 1995 to 2004, said this would include whether the inspection program, developed by the airline and approved by the F.A.A., was adequate, and whether the plan was followed.\n\nAnother issue, Mr. Goglia said, is the replacement of the original piston-driven engines with the more powerful turbines, which generate high-frequency vibrations.\n\n''The engine mod is certainly suspect,'' he said. ''This airplane has been flying since the 40's, and wings haven't fallen off the ones that haven't been re-engined.''"

        "document": "Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the Bush administration has repeatedly tried to dodge the Constitution while prosecuting the war on terror. In the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called 20th hijacker, the Justice Department is once again attempting to trample the Bill of Rights -- in this case, by denying Mr. Moussaoui the right to see evidence critical to his defense. The judge should not allow the government to have its way.\n\nThe dispute now raging in the Moussaoui case is over whether the defendant will be permitted to question Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a captured member of Al Qaeda who played a key role in the Sept. 11 conspiracy. Mr. bin al-Shibh is mentioned prominently in Mr. Moussaoui's indictment, and it is possible he could provide evidence that could assist Mr. Moussaoui in his defense.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right ''to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor,'' and Judge Leonie Brinkema has properly ordered the government to make Mr. bin al-Shibh available. But prosecutors have refused, arguing that allowing Mr. Moussaoui to question Mr. bin al-Shibh would pose a threat to national security. Faced with the government's defiance, Judge Brinkema can strike counts from the indictment that involve Mr. bin al-Shibh, or dismiss the entire case.\n\nAllowing the government to deny access to Mr. bin al-Shibh with impunity would set the dangerous precedent that important constitutional rights can be taken away in terrorism cases. It is not at all clear that allowing Mr. Moussaoui to question Mr. bin al-Shibh in carefully monitored circumstances would threaten national security. If the Justice Department is convinced it would, it can adjust the charges against Mr. Moussaoui so Mr. bin al-Shibh's testimony is no longer necessary.\n\nThe government has put Judge Brinkema in a bind by suggesting that if it does not like her rulings it will simply transfer Mr. Moussaoui's case to a military tribunal. Tribunals must not become an end run around two centuries of constitutional law. And in any case, it is far from certain that the Supreme Court would allow tribunals to convict people without according them the rights guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. The war on terrorism has not repealed the Constitution, and Judge Brinkema must ensure that it applies fully in Mr. Moussaoui's case."

''But we have played a lot of matches without him now and think we have solid replacements.''\n\nConversely, in the Women's United Soccer Association, the Power will have Tiffeny Milbrett back from the national team for its match with the San Jose CyberRays, the defending champions. Milbrett, who was called away to play in a friendly match against Finland last week, will be up front for tomorrow's contest at Mitchel Field. The Power (1-2) is under .500 for the first time in its brief history. Like the MetroStars, it is having trouble scoring goals.\n\n''I think that it is important from a confidence standpoint for us to come out of this game with at least a point,'' Power Coach Pat Farmer said. ''It's early, but if we can come out of these first four games at 2-2, I would be pretty happy with our start.''\n\nSOCCER"

        "document": "What makes the New York suburbs work is a kind of osmosis. Men and women (the early birds, anyway) leave their homes -- their ranches, their splits, their Tudors, their Colonials, their McMansions -- while the dew is still wet; they're siphoned into the city and up into the mighty towers of midtown and Wall Street; and in the cool of the evening they're exhaled again. This process (and the greenbacks it photosynthesizes) keeps our enclaves leafy and prosperous, and it accounts for that deep, almost churchly silence that settles over a suburban neighborhood in the middle of a weekday morning -- after the commuters have driven away and the carpools have whisked the kids off to school, but before the FedEx truck comes around and the yard crews turn up with their mowers and blowers.\n\nOn that Tuesday, the process was interrupted; the tunnels and bridges were closed down -- the capillaries that shuttle suburbanites back and forth. Some people -- the slackers and slugabeds who like to sneak in after 9 -- never made it to the city. Those who did had trouble coming home and found themselves unaccustomedly wandering the city on foot. And many, of course, never came home at all.\n\nAs the day wore on, that midmorning quiet turned fraught and creepy. This happened everywhere -- in Westchester and Rockland and Connecticut -- but especially in the New Jersey suburbs, which are so convenient to Wall Street and every day pour hordes of commuters along the turnpike, across the river or over the rails and into the PATH, all of them headed downtown.\n\nThe weather couldn't have been nicer. It was a sparkling late-summer day, the kind of day that makes the suburbs look like a million bucks, every leaf in place, the swimming pools as blue as jewels. It was the kind of day that makes your mortgage seem like a bargain, when you can't imagine living anywhere else. And yet as the shadows lengthened, turning the lawns an even deeper, richer green, people began to gather at bus stops and train stations (where rows of cars sat unclaimed), or else on someone's deck or patio. Many of them had cell phones, which had suddenly become a kind of talisman of suburban life -- an emblem of connected disconnectedness. The city right then seemed impossibly far away and at the same time unbearably close. From the hill on Route 17 in Ramsey, N.J., you could see the skyline, the way you always can on a clear day -- that Oz-like view, only this time shrouded in smoke.\n\nAs night fell, those of us who were home had a gin and tonic or a glass of chardonnay -- the suburban elixirs -- and exchanged news, what little there was. Like everyone else in America, we realized, we were living in someplace new. Its exact boundaries were still unclear, but wherever it was, it had no suburbs.\n\nECHOES Charles McGrath is editor of The New York Times Book Review."

        "document": "New York's airports rank No. 1 in cancellations and late departures. But while passengers are waiting, they can eat and drink well in nicely designed spaces.\n\nThis, at least, is the conclusion of the Best Concessions Contest conducted by Airport Retail News, an industry newsletter, which awarded Kennedy and La Guardia Airports six first-place prizes, more than any other system in the country.\n\nCertificates were mailed last week to the winners, whose names were announced in February. Fifty airports were nominated.\n\nThe 27 aviation experts who served as judges for the annual contest gave Terminal 1 of Kennedy Airport the top prize for best concessions program design for a small airport (since the terminal has less than four million departing passengers annually, it officially qualifies as ''small''), noting its ''excellent architecture'' and ''great public spaces.''\n\nThe terminal, which is operated by Air France, Japan Airlines, Korean Air and Lufthansa, also received an award for best redeveloped concessions program, given for its ''nice mix of stores'' and good layout. And it won for best overall program for its shops' ''nice upscale feel'' and good visibility.\n\nLa Guardia took home three first-place awards thanks to Figs, a Mediterranean-style restaurant in the central terminal that opened last year. Figs won awards for best airport restaurant design, as best branded food operator and for best new food and beverage concept. The judges called Figs ''the best airport restaurant in the country,'' and added, ''Great food, service and environment at a reasonable price.''\n\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the agency that operates the airports, took some credit for the awards, citing its continuing $15 billion redevelopment program. ''We asked people what they wanted and they said higher quality and more variety,'' said Joanne Paternoster, the Port Authority's assistant director of customer services. ''Concessions are important to them.''\n\nBut not, perhaps, the most important thing.\n\n''I'd eat at McDonald's any day,'' said Diane Wright, an investment banker from Brooklyn Heights who travels a lot for her job, ''if it meant I could get out of La Guardia on schedule.''\n\nHOPE REEVES\n\nNEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK AIRPORTS"

        "document": "At a seaside Mass here, Pope John Paul II called for reconciliation throughout the former Yugoslavia and urged the world to do more for the victims of the Balkan war that ended not long ago in Croatia and that has most recently raged in Kosovo.\n\n''How could we not recall with anxious concern the continuing tragedy taking place in nearby Kosovo?'' the Pope asked from a vast podium built to look like a ship's prow before hundreds of thousands of people squeezed along the shore and on bobbing boats in the water. ''May understanding, mutual respect, forgiveness and reconciliation at last take the place of violence and destruction.''\n\nHe urged the international community to ''not fail to provide its timely help.''\n\nThe Pope's visit was joyously welcomed by Croats and the nationalist Government of President Franjo Tudjman. Mr. Tudjman's popularity has waned even among Catholics under his strong-armed leadership and the country's economic and social troubles. The Archbishop of Zagreb, Msgr. Josip Bozanic, who is 49 and was appointed a year ago, has often spoken out against corruption and other failings in the Government.\n\nThe Croatian President took every opportunity to place himself at the Pope's side during the three-day visit. He had to give up delivering a speech during a courtesy visit after the Pope arrived an hour late, but he had a private audience on Saturday afternoon in his presidential palace in Zagreb.\n\nThe Pope did not give his host a blank check. At the Mass, and later in his farewell remarks at the airport, John Paul II rather pointedly called on Croats to make ''society and its civil institutions more democratic'' in a country that is rarely described as open and free.\n\n''After long years of dictatorship and the terrible experiences of violence which the peoples of this region have undergone,'' he said at the airport, ''it is now necessary to make every effort to construct a democracy based on the moral values inscribed in the very nature of the human being.''\n\nFor much of the visit, however, the Pope's attention was focused on another, more remote conflict, namely the Roman Catholic Church's struggle against Communism during the cold war, which the Polish-born Pope experienced first-hand. He arrived in Croatia, a country of four million that is more than 75 percent Catholic, on Friday to beatify one of Croatia's national heros, Alojzije Cardinal Stepinac, who was persecuted by Tito after World War II and died under house arrest in 1960.\n\nBeatification is the final step before sainthood, and the homage was controversial. Though many historians say Cardinal Stepinac helped save hundreds of Jewish and other lives during the war, he was tried as a Nazi collaborator by the Communists. He is still viewed by Orthodox Serbs as the symbol of the Croatian Catholic Church's complicity with the Ustashe, the World War II fascist regime that killed tens if not hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews and other minorities.\n\nThe Tudjman Government has sought to rehabilitate the Ustashe regime as the founder of the modern, independent Croatian state. Croatia's centuries-old Serbian minority has mostly left or been driven out of Mr. Tudjman's state.\n\nIn 1994, when John Paul made his first papal visit to Croatia, it was still in the throes of a war started when Croatia broke a way from Yugoslavia in 1991 and lost a third of its territory to Serbs. This year, the United Nations returned control of the last Serb-dominated area in Croatia, Eastern Slavonia, to the Croatian Government. Prosperity has not yet returned.\n\nBut as the Pope lamented Croatia's tragic past and uncertain present, he also reminded Catholics not to follow the West too closely in its search for a better future. At a meeting with the Croatian Bishops Conference after the Mass today, he said, ''Today, in the new democratic climate, it is necessary to give strong support to the new evangelization, so that the human person, the family and society as a whole will not be harmed and fall into the trap of consumerism and hedonism.''"
